Welcome to CTL SC1x Fundamentals of Supply Chain

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,600
Management and Logistics.

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:08,540
In this lecture, all I want to do

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,130
is introduce concepts of Supply Chain Management and Logistics,

5
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,840
and set the stage for the remainder of the course.

6
00:00:14,840 --> 00:00:16,770
But first, let's talk about some supply

7
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,770
chains for a few different products.

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:22,980
And so what I'm showing here are four very different products

9
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,770
that you would think have very different supply chains.

10
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:26,920
And you'd be right.

11
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:29,570
In the top left, we have bananas being

12
00:00:29,570 --> 00:00:31,870
sold in a U.S. grocery store.

13
00:00:31,870 --> 00:00:35,350
On the right, we have an integrated ignition assembly.

14
00:00:35,350 --> 00:00:38,800
On the bottom right, we have women's pumps.

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:40,510
On the bottom left, we have a bunch

16
00:00:40,510 --> 00:00:43,290
of bags of cement-- of concrete.

17
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:46,250
So if you look at these, you'd think, wow!

18
00:00:46,250 --> 00:00:49,269
There's nothing that could be similar in these supply chains.

19
00:00:49,269 --> 00:00:51,560
And the interesting thing about supply chain management
