00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,041
Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,625
For this video today,
I will be switching into English

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,000
for my international friends and fans.

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:30,333
The story I will be telling you today
is one of my absolute favorites,

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:35,041
and, um, I hope you too
will get great enjoyment out of it,

7
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,250
like I do.

8
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,916
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>in a faraway land called Munich…</i>

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>Far away, that is,</i>
<i>if you're one of my international friends.</i>

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,791
<i>There was an old brick building</i>
<i>on the edge of the city.</i>

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,666
<i>The building was the factory</i>
<i>of a respectable locksmith</i>

12
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,416
<i>named Hans Wagner.</i>

13
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:05,166
<i>He was once a hard-working family man,</i>
<i>a pillar of the community,</i>

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>until his wife and son died tragically.</i>

15
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,833
<i>In his waning years,</i>
<i>his greatest work truly began.</i>

16
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:19,333
<i>A series of four safes, one for each opera</i>
<i>of Richard Wagner's legendary</i> Ring <i>cycle,</i>

17
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>comprised of four epic operas</i>
<i>with roots in Norse mythology.</i>

18
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,541
<i>The four safes being…</i>

19
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,708
Das Rheingold,

20
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,875
Die Walküre <i>or </i>The Valkyrie,

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,041
<i>the </i>Siegfried…

22
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,708
<i>and finally the</i> Götterdämmerung,

23
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,041
<i>also known as the </i>Twilight of the Gods.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,291
<i>To Hans Wagner,</i>
<i>a lock, a safe, were puzzles.</i>

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,791
<i>Puzzles that could only be solved</i>

26
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,458
<i>by those truly worthy</i>
<i>of the secrets they guarded.</i>

27
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,375
<i>Legend has it, if you attempt</i>
<i>to crack the locks by force,</i>

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>the contents will be incinerated</i>

29
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,041
<i>and they will lock forever.</i>

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,083
<i>But Hans' work did not end</i>
<i>with the </i>Ring<i> cycle.</i>

31
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>He had one more safe to build.</i>

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,416
<i>The safe his whole life</i>
<i>had been leading to,</i>

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,166
<i>capable of containing</i>
<i>all his anguish and misery,</i>

34
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,541
<i>locking it away for good.</i>

35
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,583
<i>People tried to liberate Wagner</i>
<i>from the tomb he had built for himself,</i>

36
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,791
<i>but his work was pure enough</i>
<i>that they could not.</i>

37
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,291
<i>The safe that Wagner died in</i>
<i>was never opened.</i>

38
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:45,333
<i>It served as his tomb and was dropped</i>
<i>into the ocean with his body still inside.</i>

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>The Rheingold,</i>

40
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,166
<i>the Valkyrie</i>,<i> and the Siegfried</i>

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,958
<i>are all rumored</i>
<i>to still be in circulation.</i>

42
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>Their locations remain one of the greatest</i>
<i>mysteries of the safecracking world.</i>

43
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,625
<i>As for the</i> <i>Götterdämmerung,</i>
<i>no one knows what became of it.</i>

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,458
Okay. Yes, this has been my video.
Thank you for the viewing.

45
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:13,041
And as always, I've been
your, uh, Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert,

46
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,291
your super safecracker. Please like

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,333
<i>Thank you and goodbye.</i>

50
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,250
Perfect. That was perfect.

51
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,208
And upload.

52
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>Tick.</i>

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,291
Okay, and…

54
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,291
Time to start another boring day.

55
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,125
Thank you.

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,541
{\an8}Here you go.

57
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,958
{\an8}OPEN

58
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,791
{\an8}A very good morning. How can I be of help?

59
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,500
{\an8}Now listen up, young man!

60
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,583
{\an8}In the old days
everything was better, far better…

61
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,750
CLOSED

62
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,541
I'm taking my lunch break.

63
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,583
Wait.

64
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,375
Oh, my God.

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,833
Uh…

66
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,125
"Want to put your skills to the test?"

67
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,083
"The house at the end
of Leipziger Str. Berlin."

68
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,833
"Password: <i>Götterdämmerung."</i>

69
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,083
Hello, I'm…

70
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,166
I'm not sure if this is the right address,

71
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,125
but I'm here for a very
secret issue.

72
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,208
Do you understand?

73
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,125
You understand? English?

74
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,833
Okay…

75
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm here
for, um, a very secret thing.

76
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,583
I was told to say
<i>Götterdämmerung.</i>

77
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,041
<i>Götterdämmerung?</i>

78
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,666
<i>Götterdämmerung.</i>

79
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,958
Who's ready
for the main event?

80
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome our final competitor.

81
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,250
Give him a big hand.

82
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,291
Sebastian Schlencht…

83
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,458
I don't know how the fuck
you pronounce that last name.

84
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,458
Me? Is it me she's talking about?

85
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,625
Of course. Go to work.

86
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,166
- What?
- Take your place.

87
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,541
-Ladies and gentlemen…
-Hello, uh, sir.

88
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
- …place your final bets.
- My name is Sebastian.

89
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,625
May I ask what the hell is going on here?

90
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,208
- The clock is set.
- Thank you.

91
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:54,125
Ready, and crack!

92
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,833
And remember, only four
competitors advance to the next stage.

93
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,125
And contestant number one is finished.

94
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,041
Three more slots still to be won.

95
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,166
Oh, wait. Oh, and now it's two.

96
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,166
Time's running.

97
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,666
Yeah!

98
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,208
One more slot.

99
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,125
That's it.

100
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:56,625
If your safe remains locked,
please leave the floor.

101
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,583
Four contestants left for the semifinals.

102
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,000
Fireball,

103
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,458
Valiant,

104
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,541
Neo,

105
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,916
and Mr. Nervous Guy.

106
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,416
Quiet please.

107
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,083
The clock is set.

108
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,791
Ready,

109
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,208
and crack!

110
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,041
Neo's on to the second dial.

111
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,250
And so is Mr. Nervous Guy.

112
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,666
Whoo!

113
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,541
A second place finish
from Mr. Nervous Guy.

114
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,333
Could we be looking at a new champion?

115
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,083
Your bets please.
Place your bets.

116
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,333
The clock is set for three minutes.

117
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:48,291
If neither competitor finishes,
we default to a tie.

118
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,208
Ready,

119
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,875
set,

120
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,666
and crack!

121
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,083
Already?

122
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,583
That's a difficult one.

123
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,416
Wow. Oh, no, only one minute left,

124
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,083
but I haven't even started
to crack my safe yet.

125
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,958
Yeah, probably because you don't know how.

126
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,708
Hey.
So this is bad news for me, isn't it?

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,125
-I just want to clarify once more--
-Zip it!

128
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,833
Okay. If you say so.

129
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a new kid in town!

130
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,625
I love you, Nervous Guy!

131
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,416
It's just training and a lot of practice.

132
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,333
I'm gonna kill you!

133
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:02,791
I'm gonna kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you little shit!

134
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,125
Thank you.

135
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,708
Thank you.

136
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,500
<i>That was when I first saw her.</i>

137
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,541
<i>The woman I would come to know</i>
<i>as Gwendoline.</i>

138
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:24,166
{\an8}<i>The woman who would change my life.</i>

139
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,083
<i>Eventually, I would come</i>
<i>to learn so many things about her.</i>

140
00:14:29,166 --> 00:14:33,208
<i>For instance, that she was six years old</i>
<i>when she stole her first wristwatch.</i>

141
00:14:33,791 --> 00:14:37,125
<i>That she was 16</i>
<i>when she first got her heart broken.</i>

142
00:14:37,208 --> 00:14:39,750
<i>And when she stole her first car.</i>

143
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,625
<i>I would learn that she had a red notice</i>
<i>from Interpol since she was 17.</i>

144
00:14:49,083 --> 00:14:53,666
<i>But at that moment, in that basement,</i>
<i>I didn't know any of that.</i>

145
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:57,791
<i>All I knew was</i>
<i>of all the people in that basement,</i>

146
00:14:57,875 --> 00:15:00,041
<i>she was the one smiling at me.</i>

147
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:08,833
Thank you!

148
00:15:09,333 --> 00:15:13,083
I have absolutely zero idea
what's going on, but thank you.

149
00:15:13,708 --> 00:15:15,625
Whoo-hoo!

150
00:15:15,708 --> 00:15:16,625
Thank you.

151
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:10,916
Thank you.

152
00:16:12,541 --> 00:16:13,541
Thanks.

153
00:16:14,250 --> 00:16:15,416
Hello, Sebastian.

154
00:16:18,458 --> 00:16:20,666
Damn it!

155
00:16:28,250 --> 00:16:29,875
Hold on, I know you.

156
00:16:31,125 --> 00:16:32,958
You were at the strange house last night.

157
00:16:34,125 --> 00:16:37,250
Sebastian, I am the reason
you were there last night.

158
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:41,041
Oh, my God.

159
00:16:41,125 --> 00:16:43,916
You were my one view on YouTube,
weren't you?

160
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,041
That's right.

161
00:16:45,125 --> 00:16:48,250
And may I say what a shame that is.

162
00:16:48,333 --> 00:16:50,541
Your videos are damn fine, Sebastian.

163
00:16:51,291 --> 00:16:52,416
Thank you. I know.

164
00:16:53,708 --> 00:16:56,916
But, permit me to ask then,

165
00:16:58,083 --> 00:16:59,250
who are you?

166
00:17:02,625 --> 00:17:04,875
I am the woman who is going
to change your life.

167
00:17:06,291 --> 00:17:07,375
Forever.

168
00:17:08,666 --> 00:17:09,541
Gulp.

169
00:17:10,208 --> 00:17:11,458
Did you just say "gulp"?

170
00:17:12,125 --> 00:17:14,833
Yes, I, uh… I said it and I did it. Yes.

171
00:17:16,291 --> 00:17:17,625
You wish to know who I am.

172
00:17:18,333 --> 00:17:21,333
You wish to know how I knew
you were going to be in this cafe

173
00:17:21,416 --> 00:17:22,875
at this time on this morning.

174
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,208
I would like to know
all of those things, yes.

175
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:28,333
I know those things
because I've been watching you.

176
00:17:29,208 --> 00:17:33,583
I know you stop here
between 8:43 and 8:47 every morning,

177
00:17:33,666 --> 00:17:37,541
get a banana nut muffin
and a coffee and eat it alone.

178
00:17:38,291 --> 00:17:41,416
And then you go to work and go home alone.

179
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,333
As for who I am,

180
00:17:43,416 --> 00:17:46,583
I have been in this coffee shop
for no more than seven minutes.

181
00:17:46,666 --> 00:17:48,791
Do you see that woman over my shoulder?

182
00:17:50,375 --> 00:17:52,916
-I see her.
-This is her wedding ring.

183
00:17:54,250 --> 00:17:56,166
And that man three tables to my right…

184
00:17:58,875 --> 00:18:00,250
…this is his watch.

185
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,916
And the dude in the back corner…

186
00:18:04,958 --> 00:18:07,458
- Are you crazy?
- This is the concealed handgun

187
00:18:07,541 --> 00:18:09,041
he had strapped to his inner thigh.

188
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:12,458
You want to know who I am, Sebastian.

189
00:18:13,833 --> 00:18:17,583
Well, there is no way to say this
that will make it sound not insane.

190
00:18:17,666 --> 00:18:19,625
And so I'm simply just going to say it.

191
00:18:21,208 --> 00:18:23,458
I am an internationally-wanted
jewelry thief,

192
00:18:24,166 --> 00:18:27,291
and I belong to a crew
that executes international bank heists.

193
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,000
And I want to recruit you.

194
00:18:32,416 --> 00:18:34,375
Oh, and don't worry about these.

195
00:18:35,125 --> 00:18:38,541
I will, uh,
return them to their proper owners.

196
00:18:40,375 --> 00:18:41,583
Oh, well, maybe not the gun.

197
00:18:41,666 --> 00:18:44,583
Shouldn't have brought that
into a family establishment.

198
00:18:59,125 --> 00:19:00,291
Am I being spunked?

199
00:19:00,375 --> 00:19:02,500
"Spunked"? What do you mean?

200
00:19:02,583 --> 00:19:04,166
You know what I mean. Spunked.

201
00:19:04,791 --> 00:19:06,583
Do you mean "punked"?

202
00:19:09,083 --> 00:19:12,916
No, you're not being punked
or spunked. This is real.

203
00:19:14,583 --> 00:19:16,875
But why me? I am no criminal.

204
00:19:16,958 --> 00:19:22,041
Because the next job we intend to take on,
you are the only one who can pull it off.

205
00:19:23,291 --> 00:19:27,666
Nobody knows more than you do
about Hans Wagner.

206
00:19:28,583 --> 00:19:31,083
And now that I know
you've got the skills to match,

207
00:19:31,666 --> 00:19:33,041
I think you're the man for the job.

208
00:19:34,291 --> 00:19:35,916
- Gulp.
- Please stop saying "gulp."

209
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,833
-I'm nervous.
-It's okay if you do it.

210
00:19:37,916 --> 00:19:39,416
But saying it is incredibly stupid.

211
00:19:40,625 --> 00:19:42,916
Okay, so… Um…

212
00:19:43,500 --> 00:19:45,833
What kind of criminating question
am I supposed to ask?

213
00:19:45,916 --> 00:19:48,333
Should I say something like, um…

214
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:54,541
what is the mark?

215
00:19:55,750 --> 00:19:57,208
A reasonable question.

216
00:19:58,125 --> 00:20:00,125
-It couldn't possibly be…
-It is.

217
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:02,833
- The <i>Ring</i> cycle?
- The fucking <i>Ring</i> cycle.

218
00:20:02,916 --> 00:20:04,000
- No.
- Yes.

219
00:20:04,083 --> 00:20:05,166
It's the <i>Ring</i> cycle.

220
00:20:05,250 --> 00:20:08,083
- Holy shit!
- Yes.

221
00:20:09,041 --> 00:20:12,208
Uh, wha… Which one?
The Rheingold? The Valkyrie?

222
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,583
- Yes.
- Both?

223
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:18,416
Yes. And the Siegfried.

224
00:20:19,583 --> 00:20:22,666
The outbreak in America, you're familiar?

225
00:20:22,750 --> 00:20:24,166
Yes, I heard something about it.

226
00:20:24,250 --> 00:20:27,666
In 96 hours, the owner of the Wagner safes
will be transferring them

227
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,541
to a vault in Geneva
where they will be decommissioned.

228
00:20:31,333 --> 00:20:34,791
The puzzle that Wagner spent
his life developing will be destroyed.

229
00:20:36,416 --> 00:20:38,833
This is our last chance to solve it.

230
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:48,833
So you're saying, in a span of four days,
we execute a series of not one,

231
00:20:48,916 --> 00:20:53,291
not two, but three international heists,
and we drive off into the setting sun?

232
00:20:53,375 --> 00:20:55,666
That is exactly what I'm saying.

233
00:20:55,750 --> 00:20:57,458
You realize what you're asking of me?

234
00:20:58,291 --> 00:20:59,625
Even if I wanted to help,

235
00:20:59,708 --> 00:21:02,208
the Siegfried is
a seven-turn tumbler system

236
00:21:02,291 --> 00:21:04,541
with over one trillion
possible combinations.

237
00:21:04,625 --> 00:21:09,041
Yes, trillion with the letter "T."
Trillion, yeah?

238
00:21:09,125 --> 00:21:12,375
Listen to me, Sebastian. Look around.

239
00:21:12,958 --> 00:21:14,250
The world's fucked.

240
00:21:15,250 --> 00:21:19,125
This window of opportunity
isn't just our only chance, it's yours.

241
00:21:20,166 --> 00:21:21,291
My only chance…

242
00:21:23,791 --> 00:21:24,916
for what?

243
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:27,416
A life less ordinary.

244
00:21:30,416 --> 00:21:33,083
Sleep on it. You'll find me here.

245
00:21:38,416 --> 00:21:40,333
We could have fun together, you and I.

246
00:22:09,791 --> 00:22:14,500
<i>In Nevada, a virus outbreak</i>
<i>of unknown origin continues to spread,</i>

247
00:22:14,583 --> 00:22:17,625

248
00:22:17,708 --> 00:22:22,291

263
00:25:39,375 --> 00:25:40,500
Well, hi.

264
00:25:41,291 --> 00:25:42,750
Hi, um…

265
00:25:45,250 --> 00:25:48,416
I'm sorry. I did not know
the secret knock to let you know--

266
00:25:48,500 --> 00:25:49,958
There is no secret knock.

267
00:25:50,041 --> 00:25:52,458
It's just a door. You knock on it.

268
00:25:52,541 --> 00:25:58,291
Oh. Of course. I… I just thought
because we're criminals now,

269
00:25:58,375 --> 00:26:01,750
there might be some
sort of special code that I didn't know.

270
00:26:01,833 --> 00:26:03,208
No need to whisper.

271
00:26:04,958 --> 00:26:05,833
Just get in here.

272
00:26:10,208 --> 00:26:12,375
Oh, wow.
That's a lot of kitties.

273
00:26:12,458 --> 00:26:14,625
We needed the most
inconspicuous place possible

274
00:26:14,708 --> 00:26:16,250
to stage our planning operations.

275
00:26:16,333 --> 00:26:19,041
Somewhere they wouldn't suspect,
couldn't track us.

276
00:26:19,125 --> 00:26:22,208
Korina found a flyer on a telephone pole
for an old lady

277
00:26:22,291 --> 00:26:24,416
who will pay us in cash
to cat-sit for a week.

278
00:26:25,125 --> 00:26:26,375
We're off-the-grid.

279
00:26:27,916 --> 00:26:30,291
But we're on the cat grid.

280
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,625
Um, who's this Korina you're speaking of?

281
00:26:38,708 --> 00:26:42,166
Sebastian, I'd like you to meet
Korina Dominguez.

282
00:26:42,250 --> 00:26:46,000
{\an8}She's in charge of logistics
and is a master hacker.

283
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,333
That movie
looks fucking awesome.

284
00:26:50,833 --> 00:26:52,000
Would you like to see it?

285
00:26:52,958 --> 00:26:54,541
It's not out yet.

286
00:26:55,625 --> 00:26:58,083
<i>When she was ten,</i>
<i>using only her laptop,</i>

287
00:26:58,166 --> 00:27:01,958
<i>she bypassed the security systems</i>
<i>for a major motion picture studio</i>

288
00:27:02,041 --> 00:27:04,916
<i>and stole an early copy</i>
<i>of </i>Pirates of the Caribbean 2.

289
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:10,041
Holy shit. I remember
when that was leaked. That was her?

290
00:27:10,125 --> 00:27:12,250
Yes, that was me.

291
00:27:12,333 --> 00:27:13,583
She's done cooler things.

292
00:27:13,666 --> 00:27:16,250
I just figured that would
interest you the most, seeing as you're--

293
00:27:16,791 --> 00:27:18,000
-Well--
-Nerd.

294
00:27:18,833 --> 00:27:20,500
Not really a way to make friends.

295
00:27:20,583 --> 00:27:23,583
I meant it as a compliment
from a nerd to another nerd.

296
00:27:25,375 --> 00:27:26,958
No need to cry.

297
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:29,375
My tears are because I have a cat allergy.

298
00:27:30,458 --> 00:27:33,958
Cat allergy. But thank you
for the compliment, Miss Dominguez.

299
00:27:34,750 --> 00:27:38,500
And this is our getaway driver.

300
00:27:39,125 --> 00:27:40,833
{\an8}The best drifter you'll ever meet.

301
00:27:45,833 --> 00:27:48,750
{\an8}-Sir, there's your ticket.
- Don't park it. I'll be back in 15.

302
00:27:49,583 --> 00:27:50,708
{\an8}Your wish is my command.

303
00:28:06,166 --> 00:28:08,083
Save me one of those laptops.

304
00:28:18,875 --> 00:28:21,041
Hey, there you go, sir.

305
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:23,666
No tips? No problem.

306
00:28:26,958 --> 00:28:27,958
See ya.

307
00:28:28,041 --> 00:28:29,416
<i>Getaway driver to the stars.</i>

308
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,500
The fastest there is.
Nobody… When I say nobody,

309
00:28:31,583 --> 00:28:34,125
I mean nobody knows their way
around an engine better than me.

310
00:28:34,208 --> 00:28:37,666
I'm gone in 50 seconds. Mr. Nicolas Cage,
eat your heart out, baby.

311
00:28:37,750 --> 00:28:40,000
You understand what I say
when I say what I'm saying?

312
00:28:40,083 --> 00:28:41,000
The name is Rolph.

313
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,041
Pleased to meet you.

314
00:28:44,375 --> 00:28:45,291
Thank you, um…

315
00:28:46,333 --> 00:28:47,166
Your name is Rolph?

316
00:28:48,458 --> 00:28:50,916
Yes, my name is Rolph. What's your name?

317
00:28:52,083 --> 00:28:53,041
My name is Sebastian.

318
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:55,333
Oh, Sebastian, yeah?

319
00:28:55,416 --> 00:28:56,916
-That's a shit name.
-Rolph.

320
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,291
Who's this dickhead?

321
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:04,666
And last but not least,
our very own real life action hero.

322
00:29:05,458 --> 00:29:07,208
{\an8}Mr. Brad Cage.

323
00:29:42,458 --> 00:29:43,458
Hey.

324
00:29:44,041 --> 00:29:48,000
I'm Brad. Leader of this,
uh, little band of misfits.

325
00:29:48,083 --> 00:29:50,708
Leader… Or so he fancies himself.

326
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:54,083
Well, if you were me,
you'd fancy yourself too.

327
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:00,125
Pleasure to meet you.

328
00:30:00,708 --> 00:30:02,041
Pleasure to meet you too.

329
00:30:03,208 --> 00:30:04,333
One word of advice.

330
00:30:05,125 --> 00:30:06,583
Don't fuck this up.

331
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:10,666
I don't know why Gwen trusts you,
but if she trusts you, we trust you.

332
00:30:11,625 --> 00:30:12,541
Understand?

333
00:30:14,291 --> 00:30:15,375
Yes, sir.

334
00:30:15,458 --> 00:30:17,583
Okay. Don't fuck this up.

335
00:30:19,458 --> 00:30:21,125
-Now I'm nervous.
-That's good.

336
00:30:21,208 --> 00:30:23,208
Yeah?

337
00:30:24,083 --> 00:30:28,541
Of course, you and I already acquainted.

338
00:30:29,125 --> 00:30:31,625
Sebastian, meet the team.

339
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:42,916
Um, what? This is the whole
international heisting crew?

340
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,166
It's four people?

341
00:30:46,041 --> 00:30:47,208
Five now, isn't it?

342
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:50,958
The size of our crew
is precisely why we don't get caught.

343
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:54,458
Ah, so is it like in a movie film,

344
00:30:54,541 --> 00:30:56,875
where each one of us
has a different skill set,

345
00:30:56,958 --> 00:31:01,666
and it's only working together that we can
pull off that which needs the pulling off?

346
00:31:01,750 --> 00:31:04,500
Yes, it's exactly like that.

347
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:10,791
Everyone, meet Sebastian…
Unpronounceable last name.

348
00:31:10,875 --> 00:31:15,750
Safecracker extraordinaire.
Has a lifetime of theoretical expertise.

349
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:18,791
But he has never applied
his skills in real life.

350
00:31:19,375 --> 00:31:21,083
Until now, that is.

351
00:31:24,708 --> 00:31:28,375
It's so nice to be meeting you
and joining the team.

352
00:31:30,125 --> 00:31:31,041
Whoo!

353
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:36,625
Okay, ladies and gentlemen.

354
00:31:36,708 --> 00:31:40,125
Over the last three years,
we've assembled from various sources

355
00:31:40,208 --> 00:31:41,833
the locations of the three safes,

356
00:31:41,916 --> 00:31:45,333
as well as more information
about their construction.

357
00:31:45,416 --> 00:31:46,958
{\an8}Yeah. We already know this.

358
00:31:47,041 --> 00:31:49,958
Can we go play <i>Mario Kart</i>
while you fill in Mr. Scrawny over here?

359
00:31:50,041 --> 00:31:51,583
Hey, show some respect, dude.

360
00:31:51,666 --> 00:31:53,583
-Lady's talking.
-All right, man.

361
00:31:53,666 --> 00:31:56,583
Thank you, Brad. Korina, please continue.

362
00:31:56,666 --> 00:32:00,625
The Rheingold,
in a small bank in Paris, France.

363
00:32:00,708 --> 00:32:03,875
{\an8}Four hundred thirteen
million combinations.

364
00:32:03,958 --> 00:32:07,458
The least complex of the three,
which means it's the least guarded.

365
00:32:07,541 --> 00:32:09,416
It also contains
the least amount of money.

366
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:11,291
Frankly, I'm not sure why we're bothering.

367
00:32:11,375 --> 00:32:13,583
Because it's not just
about the money, Brad.

368
00:32:13,666 --> 00:32:15,416
It's about the quest.

369
00:32:15,500 --> 00:32:18,166
- Ah, right. Yeah, the quest.
- The quest, yeah.

370
00:32:18,250 --> 00:32:20,166
- The quest.
- Next.

371
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:24,000
{\an8}The Valkyrie, in a high security bank
in Prague, Czech Republic.

372
00:32:24,083 --> 00:32:27,541
{\an8}About 235 billion combinations.

373
00:32:27,625 --> 00:32:31,791
Estimated to contain
the equivalent of $40 million.

374
00:32:31,875 --> 00:32:33,666
That's American goddamn dollars.

375
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,833
- We're getting in.
- Yeah, Brad, let's get that money.

376
00:32:36,916 --> 00:32:41,125
And the Siegfried,
in a casino in St. Moritz, Switzerland.

377
00:32:41,208 --> 00:32:43,333
{\an8}Seventy-two trillion combinations.

378
00:32:43,416 --> 00:32:47,250
Said to contain as much as $100 million.

379
00:32:48,416 --> 00:32:51,416
All of the Wagner safes
are under the ownership

380
00:32:51,958 --> 00:32:56,333
of infamous billionaire, Bly Tanaka.

381
00:32:56,416 --> 00:32:59,916
A man whose money we most certainly
do not wish to be caught stealing.

382
00:33:00,708 --> 00:33:01,791
Any questions?

383
00:33:01,875 --> 00:33:04,291
-No.
-Yes, many. Hundreds.

384
00:33:04,375 --> 00:33:06,500
We'll have to answer them on the way then.

385
00:33:07,250 --> 00:33:08,416
We've no time to waste.

386
00:33:24,583 --> 00:33:26,083
This is gonna be a breeze.

387
00:33:26,166 --> 00:33:28,708
Old Joe's looking extra old this morning.

388
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:29,916
Yeah, and very lazy.

389
00:33:31,625 --> 00:33:32,750
And old.

390
00:33:35,583 --> 00:33:37,666
Guns. We have guns?

391
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:40,250
-Yeah, only as a last resort.
-Pow!

392
00:33:41,333 --> 00:33:42,500
Didn't tell me we have guns.

393
00:33:42,583 --> 00:33:45,000
Don't worry, I don't actually
let him load it anymore.

394
00:33:45,083 --> 00:33:46,833
He thinks
it makes him look cool.

395
00:33:46,916 --> 00:33:49,708
-What are you two whispering about?
-I'm trying to comfort the poor man,

396
00:33:49,791 --> 00:33:51,708
so please put the gun away.
He's in a panic.

397
00:33:51,791 --> 00:33:52,625
-It's away.
-Thanks.

398
00:33:52,708 --> 00:33:54,333
What's wrong with him?
Why's he freaking?

399
00:33:54,416 --> 00:33:56,583
Perhaps because we're about to do
the robbing of a bank.

400
00:33:57,583 --> 00:33:59,708
It's not a bank, it's a credit union.

401
00:33:59,791 --> 00:34:00,791
What's the difference?

402
00:34:00,875 --> 00:34:02,333
It's a bank for children.

403
00:34:03,416 --> 00:34:05,750
Why would there be a bank
specifically for kids?

404
00:34:05,833 --> 00:34:08,833
Okay,
she means it's child's play.

405
00:34:08,916 --> 00:34:12,125
Remember we said we are carrying out
the heist in order of difficulty.

406
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:14,041
-Yeah, you're right.
-Okay.

407
00:34:14,125 --> 00:34:17,875
So they get more dangerous and more
exciting with each subsequent one. Fuck.

408
00:34:17,958 --> 00:34:20,000
No, it's so that if we get caught
in the next ones,

409
00:34:20,083 --> 00:34:22,791
we already have some money stashed away
for when we get out of the joint.

410
00:34:23,375 --> 00:34:25,000
What? Oh, no.

411
00:34:25,083 --> 00:34:28,291
Oh, God. Oh, shit.
I'm getting dizzy.

412
00:34:28,375 --> 00:34:31,208
-Oh, no.
-We're good. The cameras are looping.

413
00:34:31,291 --> 00:34:33,791
-What if we get caught?
-We won't get caught.

414
00:34:33,875 --> 00:34:35,583
This one will be almost comically easy.

415
00:34:35,666 --> 00:34:37,125
-Comically?
-Comically.

416
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,875
You know how sometimes in a heist movie,

417
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:41,333
they show flash-forward
of how the heist should work?

418
00:34:41,416 --> 00:34:43,000
And it never goes according to plan,

419
00:34:43,083 --> 00:34:44,708
and everything gets messed up in some way.

420
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:45,791
Yes, I do know this.

421
00:34:45,875 --> 00:34:48,916
Well, this one is actually
gonna go that smoothly.

422
00:34:53,166 --> 00:34:54,541
Shall we go over it once more?

423
00:34:55,125 --> 00:34:56,166
Yes.

424
00:34:57,041 --> 00:34:59,125
<i>All right, you'll go in first.</i>

425
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,666
<i>And remember,</i>
<i>you will no doubt be sweating profusely.</i>

426
00:35:02,750 --> 00:35:04,708
<i>So be sure to wipe it off of your face.</i>

427
00:35:12,416 --> 00:35:13,666
<i>Once you're inside,</i>

428
00:35:13,750 --> 00:35:16,833
<i>don't look around too much.</i>
<i>Head straight to the bathroom.</i>

429
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,791
<i>We have</i>
<i>scoped out the location</i>

430
00:35:18,875 --> 00:35:20,666
<i>and found people</i>
<i>go into the bank all the time</i>

431
00:35:20,750 --> 00:35:23,500
<i>exclusively to, uh, take shits.</i>

432
00:35:26,041 --> 00:35:26,875
My God.

433
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:30,333
<i>I'll follow,</i>
<i>lifting the keys off the security guard,</i>

434
00:35:30,416 --> 00:35:32,583
<i>which may be</i>
<i>the easiest part of all of this…</i>

435
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:36,000
Excuse me, sir.
Could you hold these, please?

436
00:35:36,083 --> 00:35:38,083
-My pleasure.
-Very kind.

437
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:39,666
<i>…as he is effectively</i>

438
00:35:39,750 --> 00:35:41,833
<i>the human equivalent</i>
<i>of a dummy in a cop car.</i>

439
00:35:45,500 --> 00:35:47,958
I have an appointment
for the deposit room.

440
00:35:48,041 --> 00:35:49,750
Ah, yes, please wait.

441
00:35:50,541 --> 00:35:52,500
<i>I'll ask</i>
<i>to see a safety deposit box…</i>

442
00:35:52,583 --> 00:35:53,750
That way, please.

443
00:35:53,833 --> 00:35:56,500
<i>…that we have</i>
<i>set up under a fake name.</i>

444
00:36:03,833 --> 00:36:06,625
- I'll leave you to it.
<i>- Merci.</i>

445
00:36:16,166 --> 00:36:17,833
<i>Korina will enter…</i>

446
00:36:17,916 --> 00:36:20,958
<i>And I will ensure</i>
<i>that the teller leaves the hallway.</i>

447
00:36:21,041 --> 00:36:22,916
You speak English?
A little bit?

448
00:36:23,541 --> 00:36:24,416
<i>Non.</i>

449
00:36:24,500 --> 00:36:26,375
<i>-Non?</i>
-Just a moment.

450
00:36:29,875 --> 00:36:31,708
You speak English? A little bit?

451
00:36:32,916 --> 00:36:33,916
Of course.

452
00:36:34,000 --> 00:36:39,208
Um, how can I say, uh…
I'm in, uh, trouble?

453
00:36:39,291 --> 00:36:42,083
Uh, I lost all my credit cards
and my husband…

454
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,708
So sorry.

455
00:36:44,791 --> 00:36:47,416
<i>At which point I will slip out.</i>

456
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,791
<i>Then I'll pick you up…</i>

457
00:36:54,125 --> 00:36:55,791
<i>and we'll descend into the vault.</i>

458
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,708
Holy mother of shit.

459
00:37:12,416 --> 00:37:13,708
She's beautiful.

460
00:37:30,125 --> 00:37:31,125
Rheingold…

461
00:37:37,958 --> 00:37:38,958
The hell you doing?

462
00:37:40,125 --> 00:37:42,750
Um, I'm warming up my instruments.

463
00:37:43,375 --> 00:37:45,250
Oh. All right.

464
00:37:56,166 --> 00:38:00,000
You know the story of,
uh, Wagner's <i>Ring</i> cycle?

465
00:38:00,083 --> 00:38:01,416
Yes, I'm familiar with it.

466
00:38:01,500 --> 00:38:04,666
But I admit I don't know the intimate
details, which is why we have you.

467
00:38:04,750 --> 00:38:06,583
-Of course.
-If you could just please--

468
00:38:06,666 --> 00:38:11,583
Um, ironically enough, it concerns the
corrupting influence of money and power.

469
00:38:12,458 --> 00:38:18,000
The dwarf Alberich stole gold
from the depths of the Rhine

470
00:38:19,541 --> 00:38:23,166
and crafted it into a ring so powerful,

471
00:38:23,250 --> 00:38:26,583
all the gods under the sun
wanted it for themselves.

472
00:38:26,666 --> 00:38:29,875
Sort of like a more Norse
<i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

473
00:38:29,958 --> 00:38:33,708
-Hmm, yeah. Fascinating. If you could--
-As Alberich tricked the Rhine maidens

474
00:38:33,791 --> 00:38:34,875
for their gold,

475
00:38:35,500 --> 00:38:38,833
I too shall plunge your depths, my love.

476
00:38:48,666 --> 00:38:52,041
These three locks,
I think they represent the Rhine maidens.

477
00:38:52,125 --> 00:38:55,458
Yes, Sebastian. But as old
as all the people upstairs are,

478
00:38:56,416 --> 00:38:58,416
we don't have all the time in the world.

479
00:38:59,708 --> 00:39:01,250
So show me why I found you.

480
00:39:03,041 --> 00:39:04,333
I shall begin.

481
00:39:17,875 --> 00:39:19,416
Could you please stop pacing?

482
00:39:20,250 --> 00:39:21,083
Thank you.

483
00:41:57,541 --> 00:41:59,583
-You did it.
-I've done it.

484
00:41:59,666 --> 00:42:00,958
Sebastian, you did it.

485
00:42:01,041 --> 00:42:05,875
I did it. I cracked a Wagner!

486
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:08,791
I'm invincible!

487
00:42:08,875 --> 00:42:11,541
-I'm invincible!
-Okay, Mr. Invincible.

488
00:42:12,041 --> 00:42:13,625
Let's get on with it, shall we?

489
00:42:16,666 --> 00:42:17,875
There's no way it will fit.

490
00:42:17,958 --> 00:42:21,416
It's not about getting all of it,
it's about where we're getting it from.

491
00:42:21,916 --> 00:42:23,083
Don't you see?

492
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,166
This is Everest.

493
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,750
This is shooting Bigfoot.

494
00:42:28,833 --> 00:42:32,083
This is about becoming legends.

495
00:42:34,416 --> 00:42:35,625
What?

496
00:42:36,833 --> 00:42:42,000
Nothing, it's just all very exciting!
It's, uh…

497
00:42:43,125 --> 00:42:44,125
Focus on the 500s.

498
00:42:45,583 --> 00:42:49,125
<i>Once you've done that, I'll provide</i>
<i>the final part of the distraction…</i>

499
00:42:50,208 --> 00:42:51,625
<i>…while Rolph waits in the van,</i>

500
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:54,083
<i>ready at a moment's notice</i>
<i>to make our getaway.</i>

501
00:42:54,166 --> 00:42:55,250
Bonjour, monsieur.

502
00:42:55,333 --> 00:42:57,416
<i>Then I'll take you</i>
<i>back to the restroom.</i>

503
00:42:59,166 --> 00:43:00,375
<i>You walk out…</i>

504
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,333
<i>…and I follow.</i>

505
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:06,958
<i>And that's that.</i>

506
00:43:07,041 --> 00:43:08,458
And that's that?

507
00:43:08,541 --> 00:43:10,791
- That's that.
- It cannot be that easy.

508
00:43:10,875 --> 00:43:12,541
Sebastian, it's already done.

509
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:20,583
We did it!

510
00:43:23,916 --> 00:43:28,583
Whoo-hoo! Madness! Whoo!

511
00:43:28,666 --> 00:43:29,750
Fuck me.

512
00:43:31,541 --> 00:43:32,416
Whoo!

513
00:43:41,750 --> 00:43:42,666
Sir.

514
00:43:45,750 --> 00:43:47,625
- Sir?
- Yes.

515
00:43:47,708 --> 00:43:49,583
Um,
I think I speak for all of us

516
00:43:49,666 --> 00:43:51,791
when I ask
why does this concern us right now?

517
00:43:55,583 --> 00:43:59,041
Uh, I only mean… Don't get me wrong,
but lest we forget,

518
00:43:59,125 --> 00:44:01,875
there's a zombie apocalypse
happening in the world right now.

519
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:05,500
So why are we spending time
on this and not on…

520
00:44:05,583 --> 00:44:08,166
Well, you know,
matters related to the zombie--

521
00:44:08,250 --> 00:44:09,625
Screw the zombies.

522
00:44:11,083 --> 00:44:12,125
{\an8}Okay?

523
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:13,625
{\an8}This is why.

524
00:44:14,583 --> 00:44:16,791
{\an8}Excuse me, who's the old guy?

525
00:44:17,875 --> 00:44:20,000
Did nobody read
the fucking briefing packets?

526
00:44:20,500 --> 00:44:23,708
I'm not going to spare you
the trouble of reading your packets.

527
00:44:23,791 --> 00:44:25,166
For the sake of time,

528
00:44:25,250 --> 00:44:28,625
I will indulge you
in the abridged version of the story.

529
00:44:28,708 --> 00:44:31,541
This man, decades ago,

530
00:44:31,625 --> 00:44:35,625
built a series of four safes
that are now subject of legend.

531
00:44:35,708 --> 00:44:39,041
This morning,
the first of those four safes was robbed.

532
00:44:39,125 --> 00:44:41,541
And I think I know who did it

533
00:44:42,375 --> 00:44:43,833
and where they're going next.

534
00:44:45,291 --> 00:44:49,125
This is the last confirmed
photograph of Gwendoline Starr,

535
00:44:49,208 --> 00:44:51,000
before she dropped off-the-grid.

536
00:44:51,083 --> 00:44:54,458
And this is the last known photograph
of Alexis Broschini.

537
00:44:54,541 --> 00:44:58,750
Although, we have reason to believe
he now goes by the name of Brad Cage.

538
00:45:00,625 --> 00:45:04,583
They've pulled off five bank robberies
in the last four years.

539
00:45:05,125 --> 00:45:06,750
We almost had them once.

540
00:45:07,291 --> 00:45:10,583
Managed to catch a member of the team.
The safecracker.

541
00:45:11,250 --> 00:45:17,166
Would have gotten them all
if Brad fucking Cage hadn't shot me.

542
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:22,000
- He shot him?
- In the ass.

543
00:45:25,833 --> 00:45:27,333
And that brings us to yesterday,

544
00:45:27,416 --> 00:45:30,666
{\an8}when this van
was captured by traffic cameras

545
00:45:30,750 --> 00:45:33,375
leaving the scene of the Paris heist.

546
00:45:33,458 --> 00:45:37,333
And the maker of the safe?
One Hans Wagner.

547
00:45:41,333 --> 00:45:43,458
So they must have recruited
a new safecracker.

548
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:48,458
That's right. They are going for
Hans Wagner's magnum opus.

549
00:45:48,541 --> 00:45:51,583
And as you pointed out,
they have chosen now,

550
00:45:51,666 --> 00:45:54,250
when the world is completely distracted

551
00:45:54,333 --> 00:45:56,625
by your fucking zombie plague to do it.

552
00:45:57,333 --> 00:46:00,916
They don't think anyone is watching them,
but they're fucking wrong.

553
00:46:03,000 --> 00:46:06,250
If they're truly going for the <i>Ring</i> cycle,

554
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:08,541
that means…

555
00:46:09,583 --> 00:46:13,625
that means we have two chances left
to catch them.

556
00:46:15,208 --> 00:46:16,625
And Goddamn it,

557
00:46:18,166 --> 00:46:19,250
I'm gonna do it.

558
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:23,625
I'm gonna do it.

559
00:46:25,000 --> 00:46:27,416
Yeah, he means, uh, we are going to do it.

560
00:46:27,500 --> 00:46:30,083
Uh, me and him
leading the investigation together.

561
00:46:30,166 --> 00:46:31,333
So he's right.

562
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:34,875
Uh, read your packets and I'm going to
make sure he's not having a heart attack.

563
00:46:42,166 --> 00:46:43,083
Come on.

564
00:46:43,166 --> 00:46:44,750
…about two more tries.

565
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:51,291
-Okay.
-Lucky shot.

566
00:46:51,375 --> 00:46:52,666
In your face.

567
00:46:54,250 --> 00:46:56,375
- Easy. You ready for this?
- Yes.

568
00:46:58,875 --> 00:47:00,208
Huh?

569
00:47:00,291 --> 00:47:03,208
- Yes!
- Whoo! That's game over.

570
00:47:03,291 --> 00:47:04,916
Huh, huh?

571
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:06,708
Don't worry.
We'll get them next time. Go on.

572
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,250
May I ask, are we
doing the bonding right now?

573
00:47:10,750 --> 00:47:11,833
Yeah, if you like.

574
00:47:12,541 --> 00:47:14,000
You know how I like to do my bonding?

575
00:47:14,500 --> 00:47:16,250
Over some sandwiches. Let's go. Come on.

576
00:47:17,291 --> 00:47:18,625
- Losers.
- Whoo!

577
00:47:18,708 --> 00:47:20,833
- Yeah, yeah.
- I love sandwiches.

578
00:47:20,916 --> 00:47:22,916
Yeah? How do you say sandwiches in German?

579
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:24,666
<i>-Sandwiches.</i>
<i>-Sandwiches.</i>

580
00:47:24,750 --> 00:47:26,416
-How do you say salad?
<i>-Salat.</i>

581
00:47:26,500 --> 00:47:27,958
<i>Salat.</i>

582
00:47:29,333 --> 00:47:30,250
He did it.

583
00:47:34,875 --> 00:47:35,708
Uh…

584
00:47:36,500 --> 00:47:37,625
He did it.

585
00:47:42,375 --> 00:47:43,458
Yeah, he did.

586
00:47:49,833 --> 00:47:51,000
Big day tomorrow.

587
00:47:51,083 --> 00:47:53,458
Protein in the meat
absorbs the alcohol in your body.

588
00:47:54,208 --> 00:47:57,458
You need that one plate of meat
for every five beers that you drink.

589
00:47:57,541 --> 00:48:00,750
But you're gonna wake up
feeling fresher than ever.

590
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:02,750
My grandma taught me that.

591
00:48:02,833 --> 00:48:04,375
Scientifically proven.

592
00:48:05,666 --> 00:48:08,291
What did he just say?

593
00:48:09,166 --> 00:48:11,041
I don't know, I never understand him.

594
00:48:13,500 --> 00:48:14,708
Having fun?

595
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,125
Yes, I'm having so much fun.

596
00:48:17,208 --> 00:48:20,666
This is the first real party
I've been to in many moons.

597
00:48:21,958 --> 00:48:23,041
I don't judge.

598
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,958
The music is very, very cool.

599
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:32,333
Who is the maker?

600
00:48:32,416 --> 00:48:35,083
You're looking at her.
I only DJ my own music.

601
00:48:36,708 --> 00:48:38,166
Oh, wow, that's very cool.

602
00:48:39,708 --> 00:48:41,500
So you want to make out or whatever?

603
00:48:43,041 --> 00:48:43,958
Sorry?

604
00:48:44,041 --> 00:48:45,833
Uh… Do I wish to, uh…

605
00:48:48,416 --> 00:48:49,750
Oh, my God. Um…

606
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,125
Um…

607
00:48:59,416 --> 00:49:00,458
Good luck with that.

608
00:49:06,708 --> 00:49:08,583
Listen.

609
00:49:08,666 --> 00:49:13,291
I've worked with Gwen for quite a while
and I like her a lot.

610
00:49:14,291 --> 00:49:17,083
But how much did she tell you
about who she is?

611
00:49:17,791 --> 00:49:18,625
Not the most.

612
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,541
Not to go crying out
somebody else's sob story, yeah.

613
00:49:24,625 --> 00:49:26,500
But she's had a tough go.

614
00:49:26,583 --> 00:49:27,958
Her parents were rich as shit.

615
00:49:28,041 --> 00:49:29,791
But she ditched them when she was 17,

616
00:49:29,875 --> 00:49:32,083
then joined a gang
of other rich shithead kids.

617
00:49:32,916 --> 00:49:34,333
Brad was one of those kids.

618
00:49:35,458 --> 00:49:38,333
-Ah, now I understand. Okay.
-Mm-hmm.

619
00:49:39,625 --> 00:49:40,833
Yes. Um…

620
00:49:41,541 --> 00:49:42,541
Okay.

621
00:50:13,958 --> 00:50:14,875
Hello.

622
00:50:17,166 --> 00:50:18,166
Hello.

623
00:50:19,041 --> 00:50:21,041
Oh. Hi.

624
00:50:21,125 --> 00:50:24,166
Are you all right?
I, uh… I brought you some water.

625
00:50:25,791 --> 00:50:29,041
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm just
going over the plans for tomorrow.

626
00:50:36,625 --> 00:50:37,666
Fun time tonight?

627
00:50:38,875 --> 00:50:40,875
Yes. Uh, very much fun.

628
00:50:41,916 --> 00:50:46,166
I think me and Rolph
are becoming very good bros. Yeah.

629
00:50:47,333 --> 00:50:51,833
And in fact, my heart
is still racing from, you know…

630
00:50:51,916 --> 00:50:53,125
You know, uh…

631
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:57,583
Today was incredible.

632
00:51:02,041 --> 00:51:02,875
How are you?

633
00:51:06,750 --> 00:51:08,750
Uh, I'm… I'm all right.

634
00:51:09,666 --> 00:51:12,583
Well, I had a little tiff with Alexis.

635
00:51:13,916 --> 00:51:15,000
Who's Alexis?

636
00:51:16,208 --> 00:51:19,583
Of course.
You know him as Brad, don't you?

637
00:51:21,083 --> 00:51:22,125
Wait.

638
00:51:22,791 --> 00:51:25,708
His real name is not Brad Cage?

639
00:51:27,041 --> 00:51:28,416
Nobody's real name is Brad Cage.

640
00:51:29,375 --> 00:51:30,750
Why did he change it?

641
00:51:31,250 --> 00:51:35,250
I don't know. Alexis grew up
watching American action movies.

642
00:51:35,333 --> 00:51:37,708
He idolized the heroes.

643
00:51:38,416 --> 00:51:42,166
You know, he said he wanted
the most badass possible American name.

644
00:51:42,250 --> 00:51:46,750
Like, I quote,
"If, uh, Brad Pitt and Nic Cage

645
00:51:46,833 --> 00:51:49,208
fucked and had an even hotter baby."

646
00:51:50,416 --> 00:51:51,708
And it's…

647
00:51:51,791 --> 00:51:53,416
It's really how he sees himself.

648
00:51:54,208 --> 00:51:57,750
It's sad that he could not learn
to love the name he was born with.

649
00:51:57,833 --> 00:52:01,333
Yeah, but we can't
all be called Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert.

650
00:52:02,166 --> 00:52:03,250
What's wrong with my name?

651
00:52:03,333 --> 00:52:06,375
- Nothing.
- No. What's wrong with my name?

652
00:52:06,458 --> 00:52:09,666
Well, it's a… You know,
it's a bit of a mouthful, that's all.

653
00:52:10,875 --> 00:52:14,875
You've never considered
something simpler, ever?

654
00:52:19,166 --> 00:52:20,166
What?

655
00:52:22,791 --> 00:52:24,583
Do you want to hear a secret?

656
00:52:25,666 --> 00:52:27,083
-Yes.
-Okay.

657
00:52:34,291 --> 00:52:35,208
Okay.

658
00:52:36,041 --> 00:52:38,041
When I was, like, a little kid…

659
00:52:38,125 --> 00:52:41,041
My God, this sounds so stupid. Um…

660
00:52:42,791 --> 00:52:45,291
<i>You know, I never really</i>
<i>fit into this world.</i>

661
00:52:45,375 --> 00:52:48,541
<i>While others were doing stuff</i>
<i>that kids do…</i>

662
00:52:48,625 --> 00:52:49,666
Silence!

663
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,416
<i>…I retreated</i>
<i>into my own world and improved my skills.</i>

664
00:52:59,708 --> 00:53:01,375
I did it. Yes!

665
00:53:01,458 --> 00:53:02,875
I'm a master!

666
00:53:02,958 --> 00:53:06,875
<i>And to document my passion,</i>
<i>I used to write my own comic book.</i>

667
00:53:07,458 --> 00:53:11,458
It was about a master safecracker
and explorer named

668
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:14,875
Ludwig Dieter.

669
00:53:16,291 --> 00:53:18,541
Ludwig Dieter. Yeah.

670
00:53:19,166 --> 00:53:22,625
I thought it was, like,
the coolest name ever.

671
00:53:23,208 --> 00:53:27,958
Now I realize it's pretty much
as dorky as my actual name.

672
00:53:28,041 --> 00:53:31,500
Sure, but… Ludwig Dieter.

673
00:53:32,916 --> 00:53:34,791
Yeah, well, it's easier to pronounce.

674
00:53:42,083 --> 00:53:45,208
-Um, can I ask you a question?
-Yes.

675
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,416
Why do you do what you do?

676
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,250
Um…

677
00:53:58,500 --> 00:54:03,000
Well, you could say it runs in the family.

678
00:54:04,291 --> 00:54:07,291
My father was a rich asshole,

679
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:11,291
one who got richer
from the collapse of the housing market.

680
00:54:11,958 --> 00:54:15,541
I mean, he stole from people
who had next to nothing.

681
00:54:17,083 --> 00:54:18,125
<i>Look at me,</i>

682
00:54:18,625 --> 00:54:22,375
<i>old Sebastian talking to the most</i>
<i>interesting girl in the world.</i>

683
00:54:23,375 --> 00:54:24,750
<i>Can you believe my luck?</i>

684
00:54:25,333 --> 00:54:28,416
<i>This was the greatest evening</i>
<i>of my life thus far.</i>

685
00:54:29,708 --> 00:54:33,666
<i>She would tell me many things that night.</i>
<i>A great many things.</i>

686
00:54:34,458 --> 00:54:35,833
<i>Some of them happy,</i>

687
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:38,125
<i>some of them decidedly less so.</i>

688
00:54:39,750 --> 00:54:42,791
<i>That she never felt</i>
<i>that she fit in with her parents.</i>

689
00:54:42,875 --> 00:54:44,875
<i>And longed for a more exciting life</i>

690
00:54:44,958 --> 00:54:47,166
<i>than the one</i>
<i>they had chosen for themselves.</i>

691
00:54:48,916 --> 00:54:51,000
<i>How stealing made her feel alive.</i>

692
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,166
<i>How she met Alexis when she was 19,</i>

693
00:54:54,250 --> 00:54:57,750
<i>and thought she saw kindness in him</i>
<i>and the rest of the crew.</i>

694
00:54:57,833 --> 00:54:59,333
<i>The kindredness of spirit.</i>

695
00:55:00,500 --> 00:55:03,208
<i>Kindredness. Is that a word?</i>

696
00:55:03,291 --> 00:55:06,208
I've done
a lot of stupid shit.

697
00:55:07,291 --> 00:55:13,041
But I always felt like if I could do
just one really great thing in my life,

698
00:55:13,125 --> 00:55:15,666
something people would remember,

699
00:55:16,416 --> 00:55:18,958
whatever happened before or after,

700
00:55:20,083 --> 00:55:21,166
it wouldn't matter.

701
00:55:22,708 --> 00:55:24,166
The <i>Ring</i> cycle.

702
00:55:25,291 --> 00:55:27,000
The <i>Ring</i> cycle.

703
00:55:27,916 --> 00:55:29,958
- That little asshole.
- Hmm.

704
00:55:31,291 --> 00:55:33,916
He thinks he can spend the whole night
talking to my girlfriend?

705
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:37,500
I mean, is my company
not good enough for her, huh?

706
00:55:37,583 --> 00:55:39,083
I'm fucking delightful.

707
00:55:39,791 --> 00:55:42,583
Maybe they're just starting
to form a meaningful friendship.

708
00:55:42,666 --> 00:55:44,583
Sebastian is a likable dude.

709
00:55:45,583 --> 00:55:50,083
<i>I know we're an odd bunch,</i>
<i>but we've just stuck together for so long.</i>

710
00:55:50,791 --> 00:55:52,166
A little family.

711
00:55:52,250 --> 00:55:57,583
But I'd be lying if I said
I didn't sometimes think about

712
00:55:57,666 --> 00:55:59,125
striking out on my own.

713
00:56:00,166 --> 00:56:02,916
Okay, where…
where would you go?

714
00:56:11,208 --> 00:56:13,791
America. Nevada specifically.

715
00:56:13,875 --> 00:56:17,166
Where the zombies are? Are you crazy? Why?

716
00:56:20,041 --> 00:56:21,833
There's a rumor that's where it is.

717
00:56:23,958 --> 00:56:25,416
The <i>Götterdämmerung.</i>

718
00:56:29,833 --> 00:56:31,250
Could you imagine…

719
00:56:31,750 --> 00:56:33,666
…if we got here and cracked the safe?

720
00:56:44,666 --> 00:56:46,875
Ladies and gentlemen,
if you look to your left,

721
00:56:46,958 --> 00:56:49,333
that's the bank
we're about to heist the shit out of.

722
00:56:49,416 --> 00:56:52,166
Holy moly, this looks bigger
than the last one.

723
00:56:52,666 --> 00:56:55,375
Why would it be smaller, hmm?

724
00:56:55,458 --> 00:56:58,041
What were you expecting, huh?

725
00:57:03,166 --> 00:57:05,583
- <i>Anything?</i>
- Nope, nothing.

726
00:57:06,416 --> 00:57:08,416
Okay, stay sharp. It has to happen today.

727
00:57:08,500 --> 00:57:11,791
Or they have no time to pull off the third
job before the safes are transferred.

728
00:57:11,875 --> 00:57:14,875
Unless they're pulling off
the third job now while we're here.

729
00:57:14,958 --> 00:57:16,833
No. They'll do them in sequence.

730
00:57:17,625 --> 00:57:18,958
Sorry. I know they will.

731
00:57:19,500 --> 00:57:21,458
-If you say so.
-Yes, I say so.

732
00:57:28,250 --> 00:57:30,083
"Junior branch coordinator."

733
00:57:30,166 --> 00:57:31,541
Congratulations.

734
00:57:31,625 --> 00:57:34,375
Prestigious position, Madam Secretary.

735
00:57:35,083 --> 00:57:38,083
-Why am I a secretary?
-Blame her, she made them. Move.

736
00:57:38,166 --> 00:57:40,708
-Sorry, Gwen.
-How's it looking, Korina?

737
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,625
As good as can be expected.

738
00:57:42,708 --> 00:57:44,333
Excuse me, a question.

739
00:57:44,416 --> 00:57:47,333
-This sounds less good than super great.
-Hey.

740
00:57:49,166 --> 00:57:51,375
All right, this isn't
a credit union anymore.

741
00:57:51,916 --> 00:57:53,041
This is the real deal.

742
00:57:54,375 --> 00:57:55,625
The real deal?

743
00:57:55,708 --> 00:57:58,583
They have a million extremely
complex security protocols in place

744
00:57:58,666 --> 00:58:00,666
to detect exactly
what we're trying to do here.

745
00:58:00,750 --> 00:58:03,875
- Literally a million?
- Yeah, literally a million.

746
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:07,541
I've been reconning their systems
for months to test their capabilities.

747
00:58:08,125 --> 00:58:10,500
Reconning? What does this mean, reconning?

748
00:58:10,583 --> 00:58:13,416
You know, reconning. Fucking reconning.
I've been reconning them.

749
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:15,958
Now get out of my asshole,
Mr. I Don't Want To Make Out.

750
00:58:16,625 --> 00:58:18,833
Ah, okay. Got it. Okay, reconning.

751
00:58:18,916 --> 00:58:21,625
I can only be in their system
for 16 seconds at a time

752
00:58:21,708 --> 00:58:22,750
without them detecting me.

753
00:58:22,833 --> 00:58:25,458
Then I have to drop out,
do the whole thing over again,

754
00:58:25,541 --> 00:58:28,208
repeat until I can get your asses
into the vault, so…

755
00:58:28,291 --> 00:58:31,416
Um, okay, uh,
not to be all Johnny New Guy…

756
00:58:31,500 --> 00:58:32,916
Not an expression.

757
00:58:33,000 --> 00:58:35,958
But this sounds much riskier than Paris.
Are we sure it will work?

758
00:58:36,625 --> 00:58:38,500
It will theoretically work, yes.

759
00:58:39,333 --> 00:58:41,500
- Theoretically?
- Theoretically.

760
00:58:41,583 --> 00:58:45,333
According to theory rather than
experience or practical application.

761
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:51,458
Realistically, I give you about
a 5% chance of survival, so good luck.

762
00:58:51,541 --> 00:58:52,791
Not helping.

763
00:58:53,541 --> 00:58:55,208
It will work. We're ready.

764
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:57,750
-You good, bro?
-Good, brother.

765
00:58:59,208 --> 00:59:01,083
Hey. Hey, talk to me.

766
00:59:01,833 --> 00:59:03,416
What's going on? How are you feeling?

767
00:59:04,750 --> 00:59:06,708
About the going to the bank?

768
00:59:07,416 --> 00:59:08,583
Very, very scared.

769
00:59:10,166 --> 00:59:11,833
About the safe breaking itself,

770
00:59:11,916 --> 00:59:14,541
"Hey, I feel great. I cracked a Wagner."

771
00:59:16,458 --> 00:59:17,875
Nothing can stop me now.

772
00:59:52,625 --> 00:59:53,791
I'm in.

773
01:00:02,708 --> 01:00:04,208
-Two seconds.
-And I'm out.

774
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:07,125
Did he get through?

775
01:00:07,708 --> 01:00:09,208
Holy shit, it worked.

776
01:00:09,291 --> 01:00:11,833
- <i>What were you expecting?</i>
<i>- You're a fucking genius.</i>

777
01:00:13,041 --> 01:00:14,125
Yes, I know.

778
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:20,625
<i>Sebastian, in front of you</i>
<i>are two doors. Take the left.</i>

779
01:00:21,708 --> 01:00:24,708
<i>I'm going to lead you</i>
<i>through a series of evasive steps, okay?</i>

780
01:00:24,791 --> 01:00:26,750
<i>In case anyone is watching.</i>

781
01:00:28,041 --> 01:00:30,625
<i>Go to the elevator at the end of the hall.</i>

782
01:00:33,666 --> 01:00:34,500
<i>Shit!</i>

783
01:00:34,583 --> 01:00:37,166
- Shit?
- Gwen's elevator is busy.

784
01:00:37,250 --> 01:00:38,666
I got to go, bye.

785
01:00:38,750 --> 01:00:41,000
Wait. Korina, what elevator?

786
01:00:45,125 --> 01:00:47,291
Gwen, go up to level four.

787
01:00:47,875 --> 01:00:49,833
Cross the office
and I'll send the other elevator.

788
01:00:56,291 --> 01:00:57,541
<i>First door on your left.</i>

789
01:01:04,041 --> 01:01:05,041
Hi.

790
01:01:05,583 --> 01:01:08,791
Pavel, for the last time,
you can't drink in here.

791
01:01:13,125 --> 01:01:15,625
- Did you see that?
- Where did he go?

792
01:01:21,583 --> 01:01:22,583
He disappears.

793
01:01:25,250 --> 01:01:26,166
Anything?

794
01:01:26,833 --> 01:01:28,041
Still negatory.

795
01:01:28,125 --> 01:01:31,375
Sebastian, the vault elevator
behind the locked door ahead of you.

796
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:34,458
<i>Go up, pretend to unlock it,</i>
<i>and I'll open it, okay?</i>

797
01:01:34,541 --> 01:01:35,875
Just pretend.

798
01:01:37,916 --> 01:01:40,625
Pretend to unlock.

799
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:47,875
- Thank you.
<i>- Bye.</i>

800
01:01:53,375 --> 01:01:54,375
Come on, let's go.

801
01:02:07,500 --> 01:02:08,666
You all right?

802
01:02:10,041 --> 01:02:12,916
May I ask, you didn't tell me
about you and Mr. Brad.

803
01:02:13,000 --> 01:02:14,291
What?

804
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:17,041
The two of you are together
in the romantic sense.

805
01:02:17,125 --> 01:02:19,500
I, of course, understand.

806
01:02:19,583 --> 01:02:21,916
-He's amongst the handsome--
-Is this really the time…

807
01:02:22,000 --> 01:02:25,041
I never said one way or another
whether I had a boyfriend or not,

808
01:02:25,125 --> 01:02:27,375
<i>and frankly,</i>
<i>I don't know what it is to you.</i>

809
01:02:28,291 --> 01:02:30,333
I only ask why did you hide this from me?

810
01:02:30,416 --> 01:02:32,750
- Okay.
- I was--

811
01:02:34,000 --> 01:02:34,833
Hold this, please.

812
01:02:34,916 --> 01:02:36,708
Show me your ID.

813
01:02:39,833 --> 01:02:40,916
Oh, fuck.

814
01:03:03,125 --> 01:03:04,541
Gwen! Gwen!

815
01:03:36,041 --> 01:03:37,208
Uh…

816
01:03:37,958 --> 01:03:40,166
-What the fuck was that?
-What?

817
01:03:41,500 --> 01:03:42,958
You karate'd two men.

818
01:03:43,708 --> 01:03:45,958
You did not say that was part of the plan.

819
01:03:46,791 --> 01:03:48,208
It wasn't. I improvised.

820
01:03:50,833 --> 01:03:52,208
Always be prepared.

821
01:03:54,000 --> 01:03:54,916
Always be prepared.

822
01:04:09,083 --> 01:04:13,041
Did you know that Richard Wagner
spent 31 years writing the <i>Ring</i> cycle?

823
01:04:13,625 --> 01:04:16,541
Much longer than even Hans spent
building the corresponding safes.

824
01:04:18,000 --> 01:04:20,000
Yes, actually, I did know that.

825
01:04:21,583 --> 01:04:25,416
Wagner's work had many themes
of great importance to him,

826
01:04:26,458 --> 01:04:29,375
but all of them touched upon love.

827
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:34,875
For instance, the story of the safe
that has brought us here today.

828
01:04:35,625 --> 01:04:37,000
The Valkyrie.

829
01:04:38,083 --> 01:04:42,333
{\an8}The first act of the story
takes place on Earth

830
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:44,916
as the children of Odin or Wotan,

831
01:04:45,000 --> 01:04:48,416
the siblings, Siegmund and Sieglinde
happen to cross one another

832
01:04:49,208 --> 01:04:50,416
and fall in love.

833
01:04:51,375 --> 01:04:52,500
Gross.

834
01:04:52,583 --> 01:04:53,541
No, it's okay.

835
01:04:54,083 --> 01:04:57,041
They did not know at the time
they were brother and sister.

836
01:04:57,833 --> 01:05:01,916
The second act of the story
takes place far above Earth,

837
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,208
in a kingdom meant to represent Valhalla.

838
01:05:06,625 --> 01:05:08,875
It's the gods' plan, a course of action,

839
01:05:08,958 --> 01:05:12,250
and Wotan sends his daughter Brünnhilde
to kill Siegmund.

840
01:05:12,333 --> 01:05:14,416
But moved by his love for Sieglinde,

841
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:17,125
she does not and helps her instead.

842
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:22,875
This angers Odin,
who decrees the most dire of punishment,

843
01:05:23,375 --> 01:05:26,041
stripping Brünnhilde of her immortality

844
01:05:26,666 --> 01:05:28,458
and casting her out of her Valhalla.

845
01:05:30,583 --> 01:05:33,625
I believe the locks are to be solved
in the order of the story

846
01:05:33,708 --> 01:05:35,416
and then the cycle begins anew.

847
01:05:36,208 --> 01:05:39,916
The themes of these stories
were the model, still relevant,

848
01:05:41,541 --> 01:05:45,833
such as deception
and double cross in love.

849
01:05:51,250 --> 01:05:52,291
<i>Great. Yeah.</i>

850
01:05:52,375 --> 01:05:54,666
Let's get on with it now, shall we?

851
01:05:55,541 --> 01:05:56,375
Yes.

852
01:05:56,958 --> 01:05:58,000
Oh.

853
01:05:58,083 --> 01:05:59,250
Really?

854
01:06:02,125 --> 01:06:04,583
Why… Oh, okay.

855
01:06:06,916 --> 01:06:09,166
- Anything?
<i>- Still negatory.</i>

856
01:06:13,041 --> 01:06:16,000
- Something's not right here.
- Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

857
01:06:16,083 --> 01:06:19,833
I'm not missing our shot.
If they're inside…

858
01:06:21,458 --> 01:06:23,708
We're going to catch them.

859
01:06:23,791 --> 01:06:24,916
Let's go.

860
01:06:25,000 --> 01:06:25,916
We're moving in.

861
01:06:33,750 --> 01:06:35,791
Got him. Camera 52.

862
01:06:38,500 --> 01:06:39,458
What the fuck.

863
01:06:40,083 --> 01:06:41,916
Someone's in our system.

864
01:06:44,750 --> 01:06:46,708
- Oh, fuck.
- What is it?

865
01:06:46,791 --> 01:06:50,416
They triggered their silent alert. Locks
the elevators until they investigate.

866
01:06:50,500 --> 01:06:52,166
So, what? They're onto us?

867
01:06:52,250 --> 01:06:54,125
They're on the path to being onto us.

868
01:06:54,208 --> 01:06:55,166
Shit.

869
01:06:55,250 --> 01:06:57,041
All right, time for plan B.

870
01:06:57,916 --> 01:07:00,458
-Plan B now?
-Yes. Plan B, Rolph.

871
01:07:00,541 --> 01:07:01,583
Yo, come on, man.

872
01:07:02,208 --> 01:07:03,166
Mr. Delacroix,

873
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:06,166
there is really something
that you should know.

874
01:07:06,250 --> 01:07:07,250
Open the gate.

875
01:07:12,250 --> 01:07:13,166
You ready?

876
01:07:13,958 --> 01:07:15,791
- Yeah.
- Okay. Go.

877
01:07:28,083 --> 01:07:29,333
What the fuck?

878
01:07:35,375 --> 01:07:36,458
This is not a Wagner.

879
01:07:37,500 --> 01:07:38,958
We're in the wrong bank.

880
01:08:07,875 --> 01:08:10,041
You traded your safe.

881
01:08:12,583 --> 01:08:13,416
Yes.

882
01:08:13,500 --> 01:08:14,666
What the fuck?

883
01:08:14,750 --> 01:08:15,958
Listen. Listen.

884
01:08:16,750 --> 01:08:18,083
Given its impenetrable nature,

885
01:08:18,166 --> 01:08:20,083
they decided
its purpose would be better served

886
01:08:20,166 --> 01:08:23,291
at one of our more prestigious locations.

887
01:08:23,375 --> 01:08:25,791
Where? Where did you send it?

888
01:08:27,375 --> 01:08:30,041
Everyone get on the ground!

889
01:08:31,416 --> 01:08:33,250
You, pass me that bag!

890
01:08:33,333 --> 01:08:36,083
Move, move, move.

891
01:08:37,583 --> 01:08:38,916
Thank you very much.

892
01:08:39,000 --> 01:08:40,041
What was that?

893
01:08:40,125 --> 01:08:41,833
Oh, uh, don't worry about it.

894
01:08:41,916 --> 01:08:44,708
It's just a little distraction
to buy some more time.

895
01:08:44,791 --> 01:08:45,791
I'm sure.

896
01:08:46,666 --> 01:08:48,208
But we should hurry it up.

897
01:08:48,958 --> 01:08:49,958
Okay.

898
01:08:54,791 --> 01:08:55,916
All right.

899
01:08:57,666 --> 01:08:59,208
You'll see. This will be easy.

900
01:09:26,916 --> 01:09:28,125
What's going on?

901
01:09:28,625 --> 01:09:30,458
-It just--
-It just what?

902
01:09:31,250 --> 01:09:33,416
It just detected my presence.

903
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:40,416
Okay. What do we have here?

904
01:09:43,000 --> 01:09:46,000
Tell me. What do you want me to do?

905
01:09:58,041 --> 01:09:59,666
Nothing to worry about.

906
01:09:59,750 --> 01:10:02,291
Uh… Okay, what does <i>that</i> mean?

907
01:10:03,083 --> 01:10:06,166
That if I fuck up again, it locks forever.

908
01:10:06,250 --> 01:10:07,125
That's all.

909
01:10:07,708 --> 01:10:09,666
That kind of sounds
like something to worry about,

910
01:10:09,750 --> 01:10:11,041
Mr. Warming Up My Instruments.

911
01:10:11,125 --> 01:10:14,208
-You just said this would be easy.
-I realize what I just said, okay?

912
01:10:14,291 --> 01:10:17,041
This fit's slightly more complicated
than I've expected.

913
01:10:17,125 --> 01:10:19,708
I don't understand
why you are so stressed.

914
01:10:19,791 --> 01:10:20,666
I'm not stressed.

915
01:10:20,750 --> 01:10:22,666
-You're stressed.
-You're stressed!

916
01:10:22,750 --> 01:10:24,333
Do you know what? Do your job.

917
01:10:24,416 --> 01:10:25,916
Stop, stop, stop!

918
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:27,541
Get out of the car. Get out of the car!

919
01:10:27,625 --> 01:10:28,750
Okay! Let's go!

920
01:10:29,250 --> 01:10:30,208
Come on!

921
01:10:33,458 --> 01:10:34,541
What? Shit!

922
01:10:34,625 --> 01:10:36,000
What the fuck was that?

923
01:10:36,541 --> 01:10:38,458
Come on, move.
How are we getting on?

924
01:10:39,000 --> 01:10:41,958
All of you,
get in the middle of this floor.

925
01:10:42,041 --> 01:10:43,333
Let's move. Let's move.

926
01:10:43,416 --> 01:10:45,000
Let's move!

927
01:10:47,791 --> 01:10:49,250
Fucking Christ!

928
01:11:16,833 --> 01:11:17,708
Come on.

929
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,916
Let's go. Come on.

930
01:11:45,583 --> 01:11:48,333
Let's move! Let's move!

931
01:11:53,041 --> 01:11:54,166
Damn it.

932
01:11:57,250 --> 01:11:58,333
Shit.

933
01:11:58,416 --> 01:11:59,833
They triggered the alarm.

934
01:12:01,875 --> 01:12:02,833
Hello?

935
01:12:03,333 --> 01:12:05,125
Fill the bag. Come on!

936
01:12:05,208 --> 01:12:07,541
Faster. Faster. Faster.

937
01:12:31,375 --> 01:12:32,250
Shit.

938
01:12:44,916 --> 01:12:46,125
What?

939
01:12:46,208 --> 01:12:47,208
What is it?

940
01:12:54,166 --> 01:12:56,250
Is this a good freeze or a bad freeze?

941
01:13:34,083 --> 01:13:35,375
Oh, my God!

942
01:13:36,333 --> 01:13:37,416
You did it! You did it!

943
01:13:37,500 --> 01:13:38,833
-I did it!
-You did it!

944
01:13:40,625 --> 01:13:42,958
Oh, you strange, beautiful strange man!

945
01:13:45,208 --> 01:13:46,583
Strange twice. I'll take it.

946
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:01,166
<i>Guys, status?</i>

947
01:14:02,791 --> 01:14:04,250
We got it. We're on our way out.

948
01:14:05,000 --> 01:14:07,833
- <i>Brad, get out. We got it.</i>
<i>- </i>All right. Let's zip the bag.

949
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:09,791
Zip it!

950
01:14:10,875 --> 01:14:12,500
Okay, Rolph, let's go.

951
01:14:21,958 --> 01:14:23,000
Freeze!

952
01:14:23,541 --> 01:14:24,500
Hands up!

953
01:14:25,708 --> 01:14:26,750
Slowly.

954
01:14:33,500 --> 01:14:35,666
Where are you?

955
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,000
Come on!

956
01:15:35,000 --> 01:15:35,875
What happened?

957
01:15:35,958 --> 01:15:37,500
-You good?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

958
01:15:37,583 --> 01:15:38,916
He's shot in the shoulder.

959
01:15:40,125 --> 01:15:41,958
- This way.
- Slow down, Rolph.

960
01:15:42,041 --> 01:15:42,958
Gwen's coming.

961
01:15:47,583 --> 01:15:49,375
Come on! Run!

962
01:15:51,375 --> 01:15:52,791
-Come on!
-Come on!

963
01:15:52,875 --> 01:15:53,833
Move!

964
01:15:55,416 --> 01:15:57,416
-Come on. Run!
-The bags.

965
01:15:59,541 --> 01:16:00,541
Gwen, grab my hand.

966
01:16:00,625 --> 01:16:01,708
Go, go, go!

967
01:16:01,791 --> 01:16:03,958
Grab my fucking hand, now!

968
01:16:34,166 --> 01:16:36,166
Move, Rolph. Drive.

969
01:16:42,833 --> 01:16:44,125
Fucking asshole.

970
01:17:14,208 --> 01:17:15,500
What are you doing?

971
01:17:16,250 --> 01:17:17,291
Stop!

972
01:17:18,000 --> 01:17:18,875
Police!

973
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,333
I need the bicycle!

974
01:17:27,916 --> 01:17:29,875
- Sorry.
- That's my bike!

975
01:17:29,958 --> 01:17:32,708
- I'm sorry.
- Fuck you, asshole!

976
01:17:36,750 --> 01:17:37,625
Shit.

977
01:17:40,791 --> 01:17:41,833
Whoa, whoa.

978
01:17:58,291 --> 01:17:59,333
Going to Old Town.

979
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:04,000
Make way!

980
01:18:04,833 --> 01:18:05,708
I'm sorry.

981
01:18:15,250 --> 01:18:16,166
Watch out!

982
01:18:24,166 --> 01:18:25,125
We lost him.

983
01:18:25,208 --> 01:18:26,250
Out of the way!

984
01:18:26,333 --> 01:18:27,458
Make way!

985
01:18:29,833 --> 01:18:31,333
Excuse me.

986
01:18:36,750 --> 01:18:38,083
Oh, God! Oh, God! Oh, God!

987
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:46,708
Stop!

988
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:51,583
Stop!

989
01:18:54,541 --> 01:18:55,916
I'm so sorry.

990
01:18:58,083 --> 01:18:59,000
Stop!

991
01:19:03,125 --> 01:19:05,708
Make way! Make way!

992
01:19:16,833 --> 01:19:18,000
Shit.

993
01:19:19,041 --> 01:19:20,375
-Sir.
-What? Oh, yeah. Fuck.

994
01:19:21,250 --> 01:19:23,458
Interpol. Anyone hurt?

995
01:19:23,541 --> 01:19:26,125
Uh, no one. They used tranquilizer darts.

996
01:19:26,208 --> 01:19:28,333
Looks like they wiped
the cameras on the way out.

997
01:19:29,125 --> 01:19:32,916
It's pretty cool actually.
Almost feels like we're in a spy movie.

998
01:19:33,000 --> 01:19:36,041
Oh, cool. "Like a spy movie.
It's so cool, man."

999
01:19:36,125 --> 01:19:37,333
Shut up!

1000
01:19:38,166 --> 01:19:39,416
Shut the fuck up.

1001
01:19:41,708 --> 01:19:42,916
I need space to think.

1002
01:19:47,625 --> 01:19:49,083
Fuck!

1003
01:20:47,166 --> 01:20:48,750
Crazy! How did I do that?

1004
01:21:28,750 --> 01:21:30,791
- Korina?
- Nothing.

1005
01:21:30,875 --> 01:21:33,458
If they caught Sebastian,
they haven't announced it yet.

1006
01:21:35,291 --> 01:21:37,875
All right, so be it. We ditch the van,

1007
01:21:37,958 --> 01:21:40,750
trade it for something less conspicuous
and get the hell out of here.

1008
01:21:40,833 --> 01:21:41,666
All right?

1009
01:21:42,833 --> 01:21:43,666
Good?

1010
01:21:46,791 --> 01:21:47,625
Gwen.

1011
01:21:48,166 --> 01:21:49,166
Gwen?

1012
01:21:49,750 --> 01:21:51,291
Fuck. What is wrong with you?

1013
01:21:52,958 --> 01:21:55,833
Are you upset about
the scrawny safecracker?

1014
01:21:55,916 --> 01:21:57,875
Don't pretend that
you didn't know the plan.

1015
01:21:57,958 --> 01:21:59,666
That wasn't the plan.

1016
01:22:00,250 --> 01:22:02,416
The plan was to finish the job
before we cut him loose,

1017
01:22:02,500 --> 01:22:06,041
not throw him into the street
like a sacrificial lamb!

1018
01:22:06,833 --> 01:22:09,083
Just for the record,
I was startin' to like the little man.

1019
01:22:09,166 --> 01:22:13,333
-But business is business, so--
-Shut the fuck up, Rolph, and drive.

1020
01:22:17,250 --> 01:22:20,250
We were always gonna have
to lose him eventually, all right?

1021
01:22:20,333 --> 01:22:22,708
They almost had us.
Somebody had to go down.

1022
01:22:22,791 --> 01:22:23,958
We could've all made it.

1023
01:22:24,041 --> 01:22:25,750
He's not one of us. He never was.

1024
01:22:25,833 --> 01:22:28,458
How are we gonna do
the Siegfried without him?

1025
01:22:28,541 --> 01:22:30,291
Who gives a shit about the Siegfried?

1026
01:22:30,375 --> 01:22:33,041
We got cleared. That is all that matters.

1027
01:22:33,750 --> 01:22:37,916
Do you know how fucking rich
we are right now, huh?

1028
01:22:40,125 --> 01:22:42,166
Fuck you, Alexis.

1029
01:22:45,125 --> 01:22:46,500
What did you just call me?

1030
01:22:46,583 --> 01:22:47,833
You heard me.

1031
01:22:51,250 --> 01:22:52,625
Korina.

1032
01:22:53,625 --> 01:22:54,583
Who's Alexis?

1033
01:22:56,208 --> 01:22:58,208
- Stop the van.
- Huh?

1034
01:22:58,291 --> 01:22:59,833
I said, stop the van! I'm getting out.

1035
01:22:59,916 --> 01:23:01,458
Don't stop this van, Rolph!

1036
01:23:01,541 --> 01:23:03,666
Do not stop. Nobody's getting out.

1037
01:23:03,750 --> 01:23:05,125
Shit.

1038
01:23:07,583 --> 01:23:08,916
Hey.

1039
01:23:17,791 --> 01:23:18,750
I love you.

1040
01:23:23,541 --> 01:23:24,958
I don't give a shit.

1041
01:23:26,500 --> 01:23:27,458
I'm done.

1042
01:23:28,333 --> 01:23:29,208
I'm done!

1043
01:23:32,333 --> 01:23:35,000
Oh, you're done? You're done?

1044
01:23:35,083 --> 01:23:36,666
-Goodbye, Alexis.
-What?

1045
01:23:36,750 --> 01:23:37,833
Oh, fuck this shit.

1046
01:23:38,833 --> 01:23:40,833
- Rolph, drive the car.
- Get off me!

1047
01:23:41,333 --> 01:23:43,166
Get your hands off me.

1048
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:44,416
You wanna go?

1049
01:23:44,500 --> 01:23:46,166
You wanna go, then go.

1050
01:23:51,708 --> 01:23:52,791
Fine!

1051
01:23:58,541 --> 01:23:59,625
Where are you goin'?

1052
01:24:01,666 --> 01:24:03,291
-I'm talkin' to you.
-Jesus.

1053
01:24:04,625 --> 01:24:05,958
I'm coming too.

1054
01:24:06,833 --> 01:24:07,666
Why?

1055
01:24:09,833 --> 01:24:10,833
Honestly?

1056
01:24:12,666 --> 01:24:15,625
I put a lot of work
into planning the third heist,

1057
01:24:15,708 --> 01:24:17,333
and Alexis is an asshole.

1058
01:24:18,000 --> 01:24:20,791
- So let's be legends.
- Come on.

1059
01:24:20,875 --> 01:24:22,666
Yeah? Good luck.

1060
01:24:23,666 --> 01:24:25,625
You too! Rolph, drive!

1061
01:24:25,708 --> 01:24:27,125
So what do we do now?

1062
01:24:35,791 --> 01:24:38,791
Probably should've waited
till we were near a town, huh?

1063
01:24:38,875 --> 01:24:40,000
Yeah, probably.

1064
01:24:42,333 --> 01:24:43,416
Let's go.

1065
01:24:43,500 --> 01:24:44,333
Come on.

1066
01:26:01,666 --> 01:26:02,666
Do we say something?

1067
01:26:04,416 --> 01:26:05,416
No.

1068
01:26:06,333 --> 01:26:08,541
Too much time has gone by. It's weird now.

1069
01:26:09,291 --> 01:26:12,125
Should we just leave and then knock?

1070
01:26:12,833 --> 01:26:16,458
Or how about when he comes back in,
we yell "surprise"?

1071
01:26:18,458 --> 01:26:21,833
That seems like a terrible, terrible idea.

1072
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,625
-Surprise!
-Surprise!

1073
01:26:29,166 --> 01:26:31,541
Shit, shit, shit!

1074
01:26:31,625 --> 01:26:33,666
All the hairs on my chest
burned off.

1075
01:26:34,250 --> 01:26:36,375
You sure they were there to begin with?

1076
01:26:37,333 --> 01:26:39,583
They're blonde, so you cannot see them,

1077
01:26:39,666 --> 01:26:41,583
but they were there
and they were glorious.

1078
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,833
What the fuck are you guys doing here?

1079
01:26:51,083 --> 01:26:52,000
Look…

1080
01:26:53,250 --> 01:26:54,125
I'm sorry.

1081
01:26:56,416 --> 01:26:57,250
That's it?

1082
01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:04,291
I'm so sorry, Sebastian.

1083
01:27:06,083 --> 01:27:08,791
It wasn't about the myth
of the quest for Brad and Rolph.

1084
01:27:08,875 --> 01:27:10,250
Not like it is for us.

1085
01:27:11,875 --> 01:27:14,541
For them, it was about finding a mark
and making a buck.

1086
01:27:14,625 --> 01:27:15,875
Right, Gwen?

1087
01:27:15,958 --> 01:27:18,375
I can't forgive myself
for being a part of it.

1088
01:27:18,458 --> 01:27:20,125
And I wouldn't expect you to either.

1089
01:27:22,083 --> 01:27:23,750
Well, thank you,

1090
01:27:25,208 --> 01:27:26,500
but who gives a shit, right?

1091
01:27:27,250 --> 01:27:29,083
Whether I forgive you
for almost getting me sent to prison

1092
01:27:29,166 --> 01:27:31,250
or whether I don't, you're going to leave.

1093
01:27:31,333 --> 01:27:35,750
I'm going to go back to my stupid job,
and that's that, right?

1094
01:27:37,791 --> 01:27:38,958
Thank you for coming here,

1095
01:27:39,875 --> 01:27:42,083
but I must ask you now to leave.

1096
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:44,250
-Sebastian, no.
-It's not over!

1097
01:27:44,875 --> 01:27:47,166
How is it not over? Huh?

1098
01:27:47,250 --> 01:27:50,000
Unless you've cracked the Siegfried
and didn't tell us about it,

1099
01:27:50,083 --> 01:27:52,125
- it's not over.
- It's not over.

1100
01:27:55,041 --> 01:27:58,250
No, I have not yet cracked the Siegfried.

1101
01:28:00,208 --> 01:28:02,000
I do not even know if I can.

1102
01:28:02,083 --> 01:28:02,958
Of course you can.

1103
01:28:03,041 --> 01:28:05,083
Did you see what happened
with the Valkyrie? I fucked up!

1104
01:28:05,166 --> 01:28:06,708
And then you succeeded.

1105
01:28:07,541 --> 01:28:09,666
There is more adventure waiting for us.

1106
01:28:10,291 --> 01:28:13,375
If you think having those two assholes
fuck us over means we are done,

1107
01:28:13,458 --> 01:28:15,333
you are sorely mistaken.

1108
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:17,791
We could still do it.

1109
01:28:18,375 --> 01:28:21,833
And not just the Siegfried.
We could earn our place in history.

1110
01:28:23,875 --> 01:28:27,750
We could go together,
the three of us, a team,

1111
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,791
to search for the Götterdämmerung.

1112
01:28:33,500 --> 01:28:35,125
But we can't do it without you.

1113
01:28:37,083 --> 01:28:39,083
You may not believe in yourself anymore,

1114
01:28:40,125 --> 01:28:41,333
but I believe in you.

1115
01:29:11,500 --> 01:29:13,833
-So you're saying--
-We need you.

1116
01:29:15,666 --> 01:29:21,500
You need me that the three of us alone
can rob a Bly casino?

1117
01:29:21,583 --> 01:29:22,583
That's right.

1118
01:29:24,833 --> 01:29:27,291
- Gulp.
- Did he just say "gulp"?

1119
01:29:27,875 --> 01:29:29,041
Yes, and I did it.

1120
01:29:29,125 --> 01:29:30,875
What's with you, Korina? Hmm?

1121
01:29:30,958 --> 01:29:32,250
You feel the same way?

1122
01:29:33,791 --> 01:29:35,958
That you need me?

1123
01:29:38,750 --> 01:29:41,208
You know, I mean, look, statistically,

1124
01:29:41,291 --> 01:29:43,666
it's very difficult
to heist a casino, so I--

1125
01:29:47,416 --> 01:29:49,541
Yes, I need you, Sebastian.

1126
01:29:51,125 --> 01:29:52,500
All right, fine.

1127
01:29:53,166 --> 01:29:56,875
I'm not saying that I trust you
because very much, no…

1128
01:29:56,958 --> 01:29:58,041
I get it.

1129
01:29:58,125 --> 01:30:01,041
- And it's not about the money either.
- I know.

1130
01:30:01,125 --> 01:30:04,625
I just really want to get my fucking hands
on that fucking safe.

1131
01:30:06,833 --> 01:30:09,875
Okay, so, what's the plan, ladies?

1132
01:30:26,958 --> 01:30:28,583
No.

1133
01:30:33,791 --> 01:30:37,416
<i>Hello, my dear friends.</i>
<i>It's me again, your great safecracker.</i>

1134
01:30:37,500 --> 01:30:39,625
<i>I hope you don't mind,</i>
<i>but the video today…</i>

1135
01:30:39,708 --> 01:30:41,166
I know him.

1136
01:30:42,583 --> 01:30:44,125
I know this guy.

1137
01:30:49,125 --> 01:30:50,916
Oh, fuck! This is the same guy.

1138
01:30:51,708 --> 01:30:54,458
Beatrix! Beatrix!

1139
01:30:56,333 --> 01:30:58,250
Damn it!

1140
01:30:59,875 --> 01:31:01,333
Come to my office, please.

1141
01:31:01,416 --> 01:31:02,541
Yes. Now.

1142
01:31:06,041 --> 01:31:07,583
I found you.

1143
01:31:11,708 --> 01:31:12,958
{\an8}--Yes.

1144
01:31:14,875 --> 01:31:17,708
So I hope this is super important news
because I--

1145
01:31:17,791 --> 01:31:18,625
That's him.

1146
01:31:20,083 --> 01:31:23,041
The guy who opens safes,
the safecracker, that's him.

1147
01:31:23,625 --> 01:31:27,625
This guy's been living alone in Germany
making shitty YouTube videos.

1148
01:31:27,708 --> 01:31:29,708
He's not a criminal.

1149
01:31:30,625 --> 01:31:31,583
He's an outsider.

1150
01:31:32,250 --> 01:31:34,541
And how does he know them?

1151
01:31:34,625 --> 01:31:36,041
They found him like this,

1152
01:31:37,666 --> 01:31:38,541
through YouTube.

1153
01:31:39,083 --> 01:31:40,333
-Okay.
-Yeah.

1154
01:31:41,125 --> 01:31:42,708
Maybe he's a patsy.

1155
01:31:42,791 --> 01:31:44,833
Look at the poor guy.
They dumped him on the road.

1156
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:47,000
He's scared shitless like Bambi.

1157
01:31:49,083 --> 01:31:52,166
I almost feel bad for him.

1158
01:31:54,666 --> 01:31:55,833
And that's all?

1159
01:31:59,375 --> 01:32:00,666
-Huh?
-Hmm?

1160
01:32:00,750 --> 01:32:02,583
-What? Yes, that's all.
-That's all?

1161
01:32:02,666 --> 01:32:03,500
Yes, that's all.

1162
01:32:03,583 --> 01:32:04,458
Okay.

1163
01:32:04,541 --> 01:32:06,083
Super important information.

1164
01:32:06,166 --> 01:32:08,083
You could have told me over the phone.

1165
01:32:11,500 --> 01:32:13,583
Nice to meet you, Sebastian.

1166
01:32:45,875 --> 01:32:48,291
Hey, it's okay, it's just me.

1167
01:32:55,083 --> 01:32:58,041
I dreamt of them again.

1168
01:32:59,500 --> 01:33:00,333
Of zombies.

1169
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:03,458
Maybe they're prophecies,
not dreams.

1170
01:33:03,541 --> 01:33:05,166
Maybe you saw your own death.

1171
01:33:07,625 --> 01:33:08,791
What's that now?

1172
01:33:08,875 --> 01:33:11,458
Or maybe simply
your psyche's manifestations

1173
01:33:11,541 --> 01:33:15,000
of your own self-doubt
and feelings of inadequacy.

1174
01:33:15,583 --> 01:33:19,791
You know, you should be that big,
tough man. Be able to fight them.

1175
01:33:21,125 --> 01:33:23,458
And yet again and again,

1176
01:33:24,583 --> 01:33:26,000
they just destroy you.

1177
01:33:27,500 --> 01:33:29,375
Or maybe you just had
a nightmare about zombies

1178
01:33:29,458 --> 01:33:30,958
because zombies are scary.

1179
01:33:31,041 --> 01:33:32,875
But they're just dreams, Sebastian.

1180
01:33:36,541 --> 01:33:37,666
Or prophecies.

1181
01:33:39,541 --> 01:33:41,166
Zombies…

1182
01:33:53,208 --> 01:33:54,083
<i>Southside?</i>

1183
01:33:55,166 --> 01:33:57,000
- Nothing.
<i>- Southwest corner?</i>

1184
01:33:57,083 --> 01:33:57,916
No sign.

1185
01:33:59,666 --> 01:34:00,791
Northwest corner.

1186
01:34:01,916 --> 01:34:02,791
Clear.

1187
01:34:02,875 --> 01:34:04,750
Okay, report back every two minutes.

1188
01:34:10,583 --> 01:34:13,458
T-minus eight hours
until the safe is moved.

1189
01:34:15,125 --> 01:34:16,166
What?

1190
01:34:16,750 --> 01:34:18,416
Did you really just say, "T-minus"?

1191
01:34:19,000 --> 01:34:20,583
Yes. I did.

1192
01:34:20,666 --> 01:34:22,791
And you're sure we have the right casino?

1193
01:34:24,041 --> 01:34:25,416
Sorry. Sorry.

1194
01:34:25,500 --> 01:34:27,125
Clearly a sore spot.

1195
01:34:27,208 --> 01:34:28,375
I'm not missing my shot.

1196
01:34:28,458 --> 01:34:30,333
At least if we cooperated
with the casino--

1197
01:34:30,416 --> 01:34:34,666
No. We are not cooperating
with the casino.

1198
01:34:34,750 --> 01:34:38,166
If we tell the casino, they might
move up the time of transfer.

1199
01:34:38,250 --> 01:34:41,375
If they move up the time of transfer,
we miss our shot.

1200
01:34:42,250 --> 01:34:43,416
I'm gonna catch them.

1201
01:34:43,500 --> 01:34:45,125
- And end it--
- Whoa!

1202
01:34:45,208 --> 01:34:46,250
Listen to this.

1203
01:34:46,333 --> 01:34:47,625
<i>I'm ready.</i>

1204
01:34:47,708 --> 01:34:51,416
<i>My fingers are suitably warmed up</i>
<i>and ready for the cracking of the safe.</i>

1205
01:34:51,958 --> 01:34:54,000
<i>We wait</i>
<i>for the shift change at 5:00.</i>

1206
01:34:54,083 --> 01:34:55,958
<i>That's our best shot. Copy?</i>

1207
01:34:56,041 --> 01:34:57,750
<i>Yes, I copy your copies.</i>

1208
01:34:57,833 --> 01:34:59,833
- <i>Just say copy.</i>
- Is this what I think it is?

1209
01:34:59,916 --> 01:35:01,666
-It seems it is.
-On an open channel?

1210
01:35:01,750 --> 01:35:04,291
Not open,
just not encrypted enough to stop me.

1211
01:35:05,250 --> 01:35:08,041
Okay, guys, 5:00 a.m., we move in then.

1212
01:35:08,125 --> 01:35:10,500
Don't you think
it's just a little too good to be true?

1213
01:35:12,500 --> 01:35:15,250
As I was saying,
keep watch on the perimeters.

1214
01:35:15,333 --> 01:35:17,958
I don't want to miss
any tricks, understand?

1215
01:35:26,000 --> 01:35:27,666
Okay. Go, go, go!

1216
01:35:39,083 --> 01:35:42,750
Interpol. We're here about
a possible security risk to your vault.

1217
01:35:42,833 --> 01:35:46,291
Yes, yes, we know. We are
informed about the risk.

1218
01:35:46,875 --> 01:35:49,291
- What do you mean?
- Please follow me.

1219
01:35:59,375 --> 01:36:01,166
- Who told you about the risk?
- You.

1220
01:36:01,250 --> 01:36:04,166
And when you contacted us,
we took action immediately.

1221
01:36:05,291 --> 01:36:07,375
What do you mean when we contacted you?

1222
01:36:07,458 --> 01:36:09,833
You did. And as agreed,
we brought transport time forward.

1223
01:36:09,916 --> 01:36:12,541
The safe left an hour and a half ago.

1224
01:36:17,541 --> 01:36:20,791
-You brought the transport time forward?
-Yes.

1225
01:36:21,333 --> 01:36:23,666
Last night,
when you informed us of the risk.

1226
01:36:24,583 --> 01:36:27,375
But the transport is already underway.

1227
01:36:28,416 --> 01:36:31,791
Hmm. See, I told you
it was too good to be true.

1228
01:36:33,000 --> 01:36:33,833
Why?

1229
01:36:38,041 --> 01:36:40,291
It was planned for 5:00.

1230
01:36:49,291 --> 01:36:50,541
<i>Hello. This is Interpol.</i>

1231
01:36:50,625 --> 01:36:54,041
Are you aware that the safe
scheduled for transfer tomorrow morning

1232
01:36:54,125 --> 01:36:55,833
is the third in a sequence of safes,

1233
01:36:55,916 --> 01:36:59,250
two of which
have been robbed in the last 72 hours?

1234
01:36:59,333 --> 01:37:00,500
One moment, please.

1235
01:37:02,125 --> 01:37:03,375
Call the bank.

1236
01:37:03,458 --> 01:37:06,625
See if they'll authorize us
moving the vault sooner than planned.

1237
01:37:06,708 --> 01:37:07,666
Of course.

1238
01:37:07,750 --> 01:37:10,625
Call me if there's a problem.
You're welcome.

1239
01:37:11,291 --> 01:37:13,041
Can't believe you drink that.

1240
01:37:13,125 --> 01:37:14,916
Americans…

1241
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:17,333
Being American makes it trash.

1242
01:37:17,416 --> 01:37:20,708
What about Zac Efron?
American actor, very good.

1243
01:37:21,291 --> 01:37:23,125
Too bad he's a zombie now, isn't it?

1244
01:37:23,208 --> 01:37:24,916
No.

1245
01:37:25,000 --> 01:37:26,375
The zombies got Zac Efron?

1246
01:37:27,666 --> 01:37:29,666
You bastard.

1247
01:37:29,750 --> 01:37:31,791
You should've seen
the look on your face.

1248
01:37:31,875 --> 01:37:32,708
What the--

1249
01:38:04,875 --> 01:38:07,458
<i>But what about</i>
<i>the security inside the casino?</i>

1250
01:38:09,041 --> 01:38:11,625
<i>We'll be gone</i>
<i>before they even know we're here.</i>

1251
01:38:12,583 --> 01:38:14,166
<i>Whoa! Listen to this.</i>

1252
01:38:20,083 --> 01:38:22,625
Fresh air feels so good.

1253
01:38:22,708 --> 01:38:25,791
Ma'am, you cannot be up here.
You have to go back inside.

1254
01:38:25,875 --> 01:38:27,750
I'm just here for a smoke.

1255
01:38:29,583 --> 01:38:30,708
Ma'am, please.

1256
01:38:31,291 --> 01:38:32,333
I'll tell you what,

1257
01:38:33,875 --> 01:38:37,291
we can share.
And I'll be gone in a second, huh?

1258
01:38:38,833 --> 01:38:40,583
Now listen--

1259
01:38:47,208 --> 01:38:50,166
- <i> Southwest corner?</i>
<i>-  All clear.</i>

1260
01:38:50,250 --> 01:38:51,333
Good.

1261
01:39:24,375 --> 01:39:28,166
So you're sure you can crack it
while we drive?

1262
01:39:28,750 --> 01:39:30,208
I shall attempt to do so,

1263
01:39:31,000 --> 01:39:33,583
but please keep it as steady as you can.

1264
01:39:33,666 --> 01:39:34,500
Okay.

1265
01:39:35,208 --> 01:39:38,375
I'll make my way to the pier.
I'll get us as close as we can.

1266
01:40:04,916 --> 01:40:08,166
Siegfried. Hello, Siegfried.

1267
01:40:15,625 --> 01:40:18,041
Do you know what happens
in Wagner's <i>Siegfried?</i>

1268
01:40:18,625 --> 01:40:20,083
No, no. I don't know.

1269
01:40:20,166 --> 01:40:21,541
Please tell me.

1270
01:40:23,250 --> 01:40:26,708
In it, the hero Siegfried
faces his darkest of trials

1271
01:40:27,291 --> 01:40:30,333
in order to understand
what it means to truly be afraid.

1272
01:40:31,083 --> 01:40:32,916
<i>He slays the dragon Fafnir</i>

1273
01:40:33,708 --> 01:40:36,375
and then he slays
the dwarf who raised him,

1274
01:40:36,458 --> 01:40:38,291
when confronted with his betrayal.

1275
01:40:40,500 --> 01:40:44,833
<i>Then he finds Brünnhilde</i>
<i>and the two of them fall in love.</i>

1276
01:40:45,416 --> 01:40:47,166
After all the pain and fear,

1277
01:40:48,583 --> 01:40:49,500
there's a happy ending.

1278
01:40:51,666 --> 01:40:52,500
Oh.

1279
01:40:52,583 --> 01:40:54,916
But what about the next opera?

1280
01:40:55,000 --> 01:40:56,208
<i>The </i>Götterdämmerung?

1281
01:40:56,291 --> 01:40:59,916
Siegfried dies and Brünnhilde
throws herself on his funeral pyre.

1282
01:41:00,625 --> 01:41:02,166
Gulp.

1283
01:41:03,916 --> 01:41:06,333
Okay.

1284
01:41:12,875 --> 01:41:15,000
Calm down. Calm down.

1285
01:41:18,541 --> 01:41:19,958
What do we have here?

1286
01:41:22,375 --> 01:41:25,000
What do we have, Siegfried?

1287
01:41:42,333 --> 01:41:45,666
Five o'clock!

1288
01:41:48,916 --> 01:41:52,125
I swear to God,
if they find them before we do…

1289
01:41:53,166 --> 01:41:56,458
The fucking balls
to double-cross their own team.

1290
01:41:56,541 --> 01:41:59,000
To be fair,
we did also do a double cross on them.

1291
01:41:59,083 --> 01:42:01,625
This is not the time, Rolph.

1292
01:42:03,916 --> 01:42:06,625
They must have
an accomplice right here in town.

1293
01:42:06,708 --> 01:42:12,000
Search the town, every hotel,
come on, every van, everywhere.

1294
01:42:13,541 --> 01:42:16,041
-Where are they going?
-Do we follow them?

1295
01:42:16,625 --> 01:42:17,458
Where…

1296
01:42:19,208 --> 01:42:20,250
I don't know.

1297
01:42:21,166 --> 01:42:22,708
I don't know. I don't know.

1298
01:42:30,666 --> 01:42:32,000
First of seven.

1299
01:42:33,291 --> 01:42:34,666
Okay, good.

1300
01:42:34,750 --> 01:42:38,958
Listen, not to be an asshole,
but you did check the GPS, yeah?

1301
01:42:39,041 --> 01:42:39,958
What?

1302
01:42:41,291 --> 01:42:43,833
You checked the GPS
to see if her phone's still on?

1303
01:42:43,916 --> 01:42:45,708
-You think I'm an idiot?
-I never said that.

1304
01:42:45,791 --> 01:42:47,250
Of course I checked the GPS.

1305
01:42:52,458 --> 01:42:53,750
You mind if I see?

1306
01:43:16,500 --> 01:43:17,541
You see?

1307
01:43:19,250 --> 01:43:20,458
Is that them?

1308
01:43:21,166 --> 01:43:25,083
- Why did this just show up?
- That must be them!

1309
01:43:26,875 --> 01:43:28,083
Come on, let's go!

1310
01:43:28,166 --> 01:43:29,291
Drive!

1311
01:43:32,083 --> 01:43:33,291
No, no, no.

1312
01:43:40,875 --> 01:43:42,208
Shit.

1313
01:43:42,291 --> 01:43:43,166
Get her phone!

1314
01:43:44,041 --> 01:43:45,666
Get her phone!

1315
01:43:46,833 --> 01:43:48,583
Get the phone!

1316
01:43:52,291 --> 01:43:53,125
No!

1317
01:43:53,208 --> 01:43:54,958
Oh, fuck.

1318
01:44:03,125 --> 01:44:04,333
Damn it.

1319
01:44:04,958 --> 01:44:07,000
<i>Sebastian, Korina says they're coming.</i>

1320
01:44:07,083 --> 01:44:08,208
<i>Where are we?</i>

1321
01:44:08,291 --> 01:44:09,666
<i>I need to go faster.</i>

1322
01:44:09,750 --> 01:44:10,916
Lock four of seven.

1323
01:44:11,583 --> 01:44:15,000
Okay, is there any way we could possibly
speed up the process?

1324
01:44:15,583 --> 01:44:17,791
Hey, I go as fast as I fucking can!

1325
01:44:17,875 --> 01:44:18,791
Sorry, yes.

1326
01:44:19,375 --> 01:44:20,208
<i>Keep going.</i>

1327
01:44:24,541 --> 01:44:26,708
- Where are they?
- Where are who?

1328
01:44:27,791 --> 01:44:29,500
I don't know what you're talking about.

1329
01:44:29,583 --> 01:44:32,125
I'm just a girl on the street,
taking a walk.

1330
01:44:32,208 --> 01:44:34,541
So you're not Korina Dominguez?

1331
01:44:34,625 --> 01:44:37,875
Known associate of Gwendoline Starr
and Alexis Broschini?

1332
01:44:37,958 --> 01:44:40,500
-Tell me you're not that girl.
-Vincent!

1333
01:44:40,583 --> 01:44:42,041
-Let her…
-Where the hell are they?

1334
01:44:42,125 --> 01:44:43,375
Let her go! Stop it!

1335
01:44:43,458 --> 01:44:45,333
Where are they?
Don't fuck with me.

1336
01:44:45,416 --> 01:44:46,833
Never heard of them. Never.

1337
01:44:48,541 --> 01:44:49,708
Allow me to apologize for him.

1338
01:44:50,708 --> 01:44:52,791
But, come on, woman to woman,

1339
01:44:53,750 --> 01:44:57,000
do you really want all of this
pinned on you alone?

1340
01:44:58,666 --> 01:45:00,666
Just tell us how they were gonna escape.

1341
01:45:03,791 --> 01:45:04,875
Wait a moment.

1342
01:45:05,916 --> 01:45:09,416
Just one piece of information,

1343
01:45:09,500 --> 01:45:12,250
then I promise I'll do
everything in my power

1344
01:45:12,333 --> 01:45:16,125
to make sure your little brother
is looked after.

1345
01:45:25,916 --> 01:45:27,291
We're fucking getting them.

1346
01:45:30,125 --> 01:45:31,583
You're just gonna scare them, right?

1347
01:45:51,333 --> 01:45:53,125
Okay. Come on, guys.

1348
01:45:53,208 --> 01:45:54,875
We know where they're going.

1349
01:45:54,958 --> 01:45:55,791
Let's go.

1350
01:45:55,875 --> 01:45:57,125
Good luck, team.

1351
01:46:06,875 --> 01:46:08,333
<i>Six of seven.</i>

1352
01:46:08,416 --> 01:46:09,791
Oh, no.

1353
01:46:10,583 --> 01:46:12,791
Shit. Left turn!

1354
01:46:26,500 --> 01:46:28,375
Okay, sorry, right turn!

1355
01:46:43,958 --> 01:46:47,208
I'm fine! I'm fine. Okay.

1356
01:47:01,666 --> 01:47:02,541
<i>Sebastian?</i>

1357
01:47:03,958 --> 01:47:04,833
You good?

1358
01:47:08,791 --> 01:47:10,583
There is a happy ending.

1359
01:47:32,916 --> 01:47:34,250
I… I did it.

1360
01:47:37,125 --> 01:47:39,833
Gwen, I did it.

1361
01:47:39,916 --> 01:47:41,833
-You did it?
-I did it.

1362
01:47:42,416 --> 01:47:43,875
-Whoo!
<i>-I cracked the Siegfried!</i>

1363
01:47:46,708 --> 01:47:49,791
I did it. I fucking did it!

1364
01:47:50,666 --> 01:47:51,875
Whoo!

1365
01:47:51,958 --> 01:47:56,250
I'm a master. I did it!

1366
01:48:38,166 --> 01:48:41,250
One thought that I've not been able
to cast out of my mind is…

1367
01:48:43,166 --> 01:48:45,583
how sad it is that this great man,

1368
01:48:46,666 --> 01:48:48,708
he devoted his life to this work.

1369
01:48:48,791 --> 01:48:50,708
Nobody ever really appreciated it,

1370
01:48:52,583 --> 01:48:54,291
or even understood his genius.

1371
01:48:57,291 --> 01:49:00,416
Because in order to understand a work,
you must engage with it.

1372
01:49:01,375 --> 01:49:05,291
And until now with Wagner's <i>Ring</i> cycle,
nobody could.

1373
01:49:06,416 --> 01:49:08,000
What are you saying, Sebastian?

1374
01:49:10,166 --> 01:49:11,291
I'm saying…

1375
01:49:13,583 --> 01:49:14,833
I finally understand.

1376
01:50:36,666 --> 01:50:37,541
Yes!

1377
01:50:41,750 --> 01:50:42,916
It's over, Gwen.

1378
01:50:44,500 --> 01:50:45,833
You made your choice.

1379
01:50:47,791 --> 01:50:49,541
What are you going to do? Shoot me?

1380
01:50:50,458 --> 01:50:51,500
Yeah, maybe.

1381
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:55,041
Will you take me back?

1382
01:50:58,291 --> 01:50:59,208
Are you serious?

1383
01:51:00,083 --> 01:51:02,541
Does that seem like something
an action hero would do?

1384
01:51:02,625 --> 01:51:05,375
Point a gun in a girl's face
and tell her to come back to him

1385
01:51:05,458 --> 01:51:07,000
or he'll blow her brains out?

1386
01:51:08,208 --> 01:51:09,125
Fair point.

1387
01:51:10,750 --> 01:51:12,541
Well, maybe hero time's over.

1388
01:51:13,541 --> 01:51:15,500
Maybe I'm the villain after all.

1389
01:51:15,583 --> 01:51:18,041
Not a villain. You're just a dick.

1390
01:51:23,916 --> 01:51:25,375
Oh, Gwen! Oh, God!

1391
01:51:26,458 --> 01:51:27,625
No, no, no.

1392
01:51:29,458 --> 01:51:31,416
I took the firing pin out!

1393
01:51:32,750 --> 01:51:33,958
You what?

1394
01:51:34,666 --> 01:51:37,625
Okay. I really think
you could have told me this.

1395
01:51:37,708 --> 01:51:40,791
I did tell you, but guess what?

1396
01:51:40,875 --> 01:51:42,333
This gun works.

1397
01:51:43,250 --> 01:51:45,583
I disabled yours
when you shot that Interpol agent…

1398
01:51:45,666 --> 01:51:46,583
Gwen.

1399
01:51:46,666 --> 01:51:49,250
…because I was afraid
that you would actually kill somebody.

1400
01:51:49,333 --> 01:51:52,375
It's them or us. It was always them or us.

1401
01:51:52,458 --> 01:51:55,916
It was just about you playing action hero,
compromising the team.

1402
01:51:56,000 --> 01:51:58,750
-You're nothing without me.
-And me having to clean up--

1403
01:52:06,750 --> 01:52:08,958
Oh, you fucking pussy.

1404
01:52:09,541 --> 01:52:11,291
This guy?

1405
01:52:11,375 --> 01:52:13,416
Get to the truck now.

1406
01:52:14,750 --> 01:52:17,666
-Is it too late for me to change sides?
-Get to the fucking truck!

1407
01:52:22,375 --> 01:52:23,500
Fuck me.

1408
01:52:31,000 --> 01:52:34,125
This isn't over! You hear me?

1409
01:52:37,750 --> 01:52:39,375
I will find you, Gwen!

1410
01:52:40,208 --> 01:52:42,666
You'll see. I'll find you both!

1411
01:52:56,958 --> 01:52:58,666
Bonjour.

1412
01:53:02,708 --> 01:53:06,333
That's for shooting me in the ass.

1413
01:53:07,458 --> 01:53:11,291
I'd do it again, Mr. Delay-croix.

1414
01:53:12,958 --> 01:53:14,416
Delacroix, asshole.

1415
01:53:15,750 --> 01:53:18,125
Whoo! Take them in.

1416
01:53:48,958 --> 01:53:50,416
Uh, Gwen, um…

1417
01:53:52,541 --> 01:53:53,375
Um…

1418
01:53:56,416 --> 01:53:58,833
I really like you a lot.

1419
01:53:59,625 --> 01:54:02,583
And I just wanted
to take this opportunity to say it.

1420
01:54:03,750 --> 01:54:06,416
You know you always choose
the worst time to…

1421
01:54:06,500 --> 01:54:08,125
I'm, uh… I'm sorry.

1422
01:54:33,916 --> 01:54:35,833
You know, I really like you a lot too.

1423
01:54:57,875 --> 01:54:58,833
Freeze.

1424
01:55:02,458 --> 01:55:03,875
Hands in the air.

1425
01:55:07,333 --> 01:55:08,333
Turn around.

1426
01:55:09,750 --> 01:55:11,375
Turn around.

1427
01:55:17,916 --> 01:55:19,416
Lower the gun or I shoot.

1428
01:55:19,500 --> 01:55:22,250
Gwen, what are you doing?
He'll shoot you.

1429
01:55:30,208 --> 01:55:32,291
One more step and I shoot.

1430
01:55:33,708 --> 01:55:37,500
Even if you make it to the boat,
you'll never make it out of the lake.

1431
01:55:37,583 --> 01:55:38,583
It's over.

1432
01:55:39,541 --> 01:55:41,833
Put your gun on the ground.

1433
01:55:44,416 --> 01:55:46,041
We could work something out.

1434
01:55:46,750 --> 01:55:50,583
We have three backpacks of cash.
You could take one of them.

1435
01:55:52,000 --> 01:55:53,708
I don't want your money.

1436
01:55:54,666 --> 01:55:58,500
You have no idea
how long I've been chasing you.

1437
01:55:58,583 --> 01:56:02,333
So get on the ground now.

1438
01:56:03,875 --> 01:56:06,333
Sebastian,
he's right. We won't make it.

1439
01:56:08,333 --> 01:56:10,291
-What?
-But you can.

1440
01:56:11,666 --> 01:56:13,791
There's no reason
he has to get both of us.

1441
01:56:16,541 --> 01:56:19,166
-What are you saying? No, Gwen.
-We can't make it.

1442
01:56:19,875 --> 01:56:20,833
Stay back!

1443
01:56:25,416 --> 01:56:28,375
I'll come with you, but he goes.

1444
01:56:29,708 --> 01:56:31,208
He's not going anywhere.

1445
01:56:31,291 --> 01:56:32,833
You said it yourself.

1446
01:56:32,916 --> 01:56:36,083
It's me you want. Me and Alexis.

1447
01:56:36,166 --> 01:56:38,500
He has no part in this.
He's not a criminal.

1448
01:56:42,750 --> 01:56:43,708
He's nobody.

1449
01:56:45,458 --> 01:56:48,458
So if you want to take me in, he goes,

1450
01:56:49,541 --> 01:56:51,750
or I'll shoot you
in your other fucking leg.

1451
01:57:01,250 --> 01:57:02,291
Get the fuck out of here.

1452
01:57:03,208 --> 01:57:04,041
What?

1453
01:57:04,583 --> 01:57:06,875
Get the fuck out of here! Go!

1454
01:57:07,791 --> 01:57:08,625
Go!

1455
01:57:09,708 --> 01:57:10,666
Leave!

1456
01:57:12,666 --> 01:57:14,166
I didn't see you.

1457
01:57:14,250 --> 01:57:16,250
Sebastian, get out of here.

1458
01:57:17,750 --> 01:57:18,666
No.

1459
01:57:19,666 --> 01:57:20,750
No, I can't.

1460
01:57:21,416 --> 01:57:22,958
Sebastian, get out of here.

1461
01:57:24,083 --> 01:57:25,250
I can't.

1462
01:57:26,750 --> 01:57:28,750
When I get out, I'll find you.

1463
01:57:29,666 --> 01:57:31,166
And we'll find it together.

1464
01:57:33,333 --> 01:57:36,583
If not, you find it for me, okay?
You find the Götterdämmerung.

1465
01:57:36,666 --> 01:57:38,458
-No, Gwen, no, I can't.
-Go!

1466
01:58:01,833 --> 01:58:03,166
Goodbye.

1467
01:59:15,041 --> 01:59:18,583
<i>Seeing that she had</i>
<i>not just gotten me a passport,</i>

1468
01:59:18,666 --> 01:59:21,291
<i>but a plane ticket</i>
<i>to the same place she was going,</i>

1469
01:59:22,791 --> 01:59:24,333
<i>it broke my heart.</i>

1470
01:59:25,250 --> 01:59:26,458
"Ludwig Dieter."

1471
01:59:38,958 --> 01:59:42,625
<i>It broke my heart thinking of</i>
<i>all the adventures we could have had,</i>

1472
01:59:43,333 --> 01:59:44,958
<i>the things we could have shared,</i>

1473
01:59:45,625 --> 01:59:50,541
<i>because in that moment, I knew</i>
<i>that of all the people in the world,</i>

1474
01:59:50,625 --> 01:59:52,875
<i>there was only one I wanted to be with.</i>

1475
01:59:53,750 --> 01:59:54,750
<i>And it was her.</i>

1476
01:59:56,208 --> 01:59:57,458
<i>But that was okay.</i>

1477
01:59:58,416 --> 01:59:59,541
<i>I would wait for her.</i>

1478
02:00:00,833 --> 02:00:05,458
<i>And we would one day be reunited</i>
<i>in the vault of the Götterdämmerung.</i>

1479
02:00:42,458 --> 02:00:45,458
- What are we doing here?
- You told me you needed a safecracker.

1480
02:00:45,541 --> 02:00:46,708
Might be our missing piece.

1481
02:00:53,875 --> 02:00:54,833
You the locksmith?

1482
02:00:57,583 --> 02:00:58,708
Can you make sense of this?

1483
02:01:04,000 --> 02:01:05,958
Hey, the guy in the front--

1484
02:01:20,250 --> 02:01:23,291
You saw the old man in the front
and he sent you back here?

1485
02:01:24,125 --> 02:01:25,041
Mm-hmm.

1486
02:01:25,125 --> 02:01:26,875
You must really have a problem.

1487
02:01:27,916 --> 02:01:32,083
How would you like to make 250 grand
for one day's work?

1488
02:01:37,166 --> 02:01:38,250
Oh, my God.

1489
02:01:40,916 --> 02:01:42,083
Can you crack it?

1490
02:01:42,708 --> 02:01:44,041
-Can I crack it?
-Yeah.

1491
02:01:47,041 --> 02:01:47,875
Can I crack it?

1492
02:01:48,708 --> 02:01:52,333
This is like showing me a picture
of Botticelli's <i>Madonna of the Magnificat,</i>

1493
02:01:52,416 --> 02:01:54,291
and asking me if I want to fuck her.

1494
02:01:55,958 --> 02:02:00,500
{\an8}Okay, the man who designed
this wonderful work of art,

1495
02:02:00,583 --> 02:02:04,333
Hans Wagner, he named it
the Götterdämmerung

1496
02:02:04,416 --> 02:02:06,500
for the final chapter in his namesake,

1497
02:02:06,583 --> 02:02:10,833
Richard Wagner's epic opera
<i>The Ring of the Nibelung.</i>

1498
02:02:11,625 --> 02:02:13,291
Can it be opened, and by me?

1499
02:02:14,000 --> 02:02:16,333
-I don't know. I honestly don't.
-Okay.

1500
02:02:16,416 --> 02:02:19,125
{\an8}Watch your fingers, Mr. Big Hand.

1501
02:02:19,208 --> 02:02:21,208
But of the world's living locksmiths,

1502
02:02:21,791 --> 02:02:24,791
do I represent
your greatest chance of opening it?

1503
02:02:24,875 --> 02:02:27,791
I can, with humility, say yes.

1504
02:02:28,666 --> 02:02:29,750
You're in?

1505
02:02:29,833 --> 02:02:31,708
It's a doorway
to another realm, my friends.

1506
02:02:32,333 --> 02:02:34,500
And providence has brought you to me.

1507
02:02:36,958 --> 02:02:38,291
We go through it together.
