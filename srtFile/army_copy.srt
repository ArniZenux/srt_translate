2
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,041
Uh, yeah.

3
00:00:19,125 --> 00:00:21,625
For this video today,
I will be switching into English

4
00:00:21,708 --> 00:00:25,000
for my international friends and fans.

5
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:30,333
The story I will be telling you today
is one of my absolute favorites,

6
00:00:30,833 --> 00:00:35,041
and, um, I hope you too
will get great enjoyment out of it,

7
00:00:35,916 --> 00:00:37,250
like I do.

8
00:00:39,583 --> 00:00:43,916
<i>Once upon a time,</i>
<i>in a faraway land called Munich…</i>

9
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,500
<i>Far away, that is,</i>
<i>if you're one of my international friends.</i>

10
00:00:48,125 --> 00:00:51,791
<i>There was an old brick building</i>
<i>on the edge of the city.</i>

11
00:00:53,041 --> 00:00:56,666
<i>The building was the factory</i>
<i>of a respectable locksmith</i>

12
00:00:57,416 --> 00:00:59,416
<i>named Hans Wagner.</i>

13
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:05,166
<i>He was once a hard-working family man,</i>
<i>a pillar of the community,</i>

14
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:08,250
<i>until his wife and son died tragically.</i>

15
00:01:09,458 --> 00:01:12,833
<i>In his waning years,</i>
<i>his greatest work truly began.</i>

16
00:01:13,333 --> 00:01:19,333
<i>A series of four safes, one for each opera</i>
<i>of Richard Wagner's legendary</i> Ring <i>cycle,</i>

17
00:01:19,416 --> 00:01:23,708
<i>comprised of four epic operas</i>
<i>with roots in Norse mythology.</i>

18
00:01:24,875 --> 00:01:26,541
<i>The four safes being…</i>

19
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,708
Das Rheingold,

20
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,875
Die Walküre <i>or </i>The Valkyrie,

21
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:36,041
<i>the </i>Siegfried…

22
00:01:37,916 --> 00:01:40,708
<i>and finally the</i> Götterdämmerung,

23
00:01:41,416 --> 00:01:44,041
<i>also known as the </i>Twilight of the Gods.

24
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,291
<i>To Hans Wagner,</i>
<i>a lock, a safe, were puzzles.</i>

25
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,791
<i>Puzzles that could only be solved</i>

26
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:57,458
<i>by those truly worthy</i>
<i>of the secrets they guarded.</i>

27
00:01:59,125 --> 00:02:02,375
<i>Legend has it, if you attempt</i>
<i>to crack the locks by force,</i>

28
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,833
<i>the contents will be incinerated</i>

29
00:02:06,541 --> 00:02:08,041
<i>and they will lock forever.</i>

30
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:13,083
<i>But Hans' work did not end</i>
<i>with the </i>Ring<i> cycle.</i>

31
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:14,750
<i>He had one more safe to build.</i>

32
00:02:15,750 --> 00:02:18,416
<i>The safe his whole life</i>
<i>had been leading to,</i>

33
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:22,166
<i>capable of containing</i>
<i>all his anguish and misery,</i>

34
00:02:23,083 --> 00:02:24,541
<i>locking it away for good.</i>

35
00:02:27,583 --> 00:02:31,583
<i>People tried to liberate Wagner</i>
<i>from the tomb he had built for himself,</i>

36
00:02:32,375 --> 00:02:34,791
<i>but his work was pure enough</i>
<i>that they could not.</i>

37
00:02:36,291 --> 00:02:39,291
<i>The safe that Wagner died in</i>
<i>was never opened.</i>

38
00:02:39,958 --> 00:02:45,333
<i>It served as his tomb and was dropped</i>
<i>into the ocean with his body still inside.</i>

39
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,541
<i>The Rheingold,</i>

40
00:02:48,041 --> 00:02:50,166
<i>the Valkyrie</i>,<i> and the Siegfried</i>

41
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:52,958
<i>are all rumored</i>
<i>to still be in circulation.</i>

42
00:02:53,458 --> 00:02:57,583
<i>Their locations remain one of the greatest</i>
<i>mysteries of the safecracking world.</i>

43
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:02,625
<i>As for the</i> <i>Götterdämmerung,</i>
<i>no one knows what became of it.</i>

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,458
Okay. Yes, this has been my video.
Thank you for the viewing.

45
00:03:08,541 --> 00:03:13,041
And as always, I've been
your, uh, Sebastian Schlencht-Wöhnert,

46
00:03:13,125 --> 00:03:15,291
your super safecracker. Please like

48

00:03:21,750 --> 00:03:24,333
<i>Thank you and goodbye.</i>

50
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:28,250
Perfect. That was perfect.

51
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,208
And upload.

52
00:03:31,291 --> 00:03:32,458
<i>Tick.</i>

53
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,291
Okay, and…

54
00:04:05,125 --> 00:04:08,291
Time to start another boring day.

55
00:04:46,958 --> 00:04:49,125
Thank you.

56
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:52,541
{\an8}Here you go.

57
00:05:07,666 --> 00:05:09,958
{\an8}OPEN

58
00:05:10,041 --> 00:05:12,791
{\an8}A very good morning. How can I be of help?

59
00:05:12,875 --> 00:05:16,500
{\an8}Now listen up, young man!

60
00:05:16,583 --> 00:05:20,583
{\an8}In the old days
everything was better, far better…

61
00:06:07,958 --> 00:06:09,750
CLOSED

62
00:06:11,125 --> 00:06:12,541
I'm taking my lunch break.

63
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:33,583
Wait.

64
00:06:38,041 --> 00:06:39,375
Oh, my God.

65
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,833
Uh…

66
00:06:41,416 --> 00:06:43,125
"Want to put your skills to the test?"

67
00:06:43,208 --> 00:06:45,083
"The house at the end
of Leipziger Str. Berlin."

68
00:06:45,166 --> 00:06:46,833
"Password: <i>Götterdämmerung."</i>

69
00:07:23,166 --> 00:07:24,083
Hello, I'm…

70
00:07:25,833 --> 00:07:28,166
I'm not sure if this is the right address,

71
00:07:28,250 --> 00:07:31,125
but I'm here for a very
secret issue.

72
00:07:31,208 --> 00:07:32,208
Do you understand?

73
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,125
You understand? English?

74
00:07:36,875 --> 00:07:37,833
Okay…

75
00:07:37,916 --> 00:07:43,291
I'm here
for, um, a very secret thing.

76
00:07:44,458 --> 00:07:47,583
I was told to say
<i>Götterdämmerung.</i>

77
00:07:51,541 --> 00:07:53,041
<i>Götterdämmerung?</i>

78
00:07:56,416 --> 00:07:58,666
<i>Götterdämmerung.</i>

79
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,958
Who's ready
for the main event?

80
00:08:12,625 --> 00:08:17,458
Ladies and gentlemen,
please welcome our final competitor.

81
00:08:18,125 --> 00:08:21,250
Give him a big hand.

82
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:27,291
Sebastian Schlencht…

83
00:08:28,041 --> 00:08:30,458
I don't know how the fuck
you pronounce that last name.

84
00:08:32,208 --> 00:08:34,458
Me? Is it me she's talking about?

85
00:08:35,041 --> 00:08:36,625
Of course. Go to work.

86
00:08:36,708 --> 00:08:38,166
- What?
- Take your place.

87
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,541
-Ladies and gentlemen…
-Hello, uh, sir.

88
00:08:40,625 --> 00:08:42,875
- …place your final bets.
- My name is Sebastian.

89
00:08:42,958 --> 00:08:45,625
May I ask what the hell is going on here?

90
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:50,208
- The clock is set.
- Thank you.

91
00:08:50,291 --> 00:08:54,125
Ready, and crack!

92
00:09:01,041 --> 00:09:05,833
And remember, only four
competitors advance to the next stage.

93
00:09:17,541 --> 00:09:20,125
And contestant number one is finished.

94
00:09:21,416 --> 00:09:24,041
Three more slots still to be won.

95
00:09:24,666 --> 00:09:28,166
Oh, wait. Oh, and now it's two.

96
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:31,166
Time's running.

97
00:09:36,166 --> 00:09:37,666
Yeah!

98
00:09:38,750 --> 00:09:40,208
One more slot.

99
00:09:47,208 --> 00:09:49,125
That's it.

100
00:09:51,333 --> 00:09:56,625
If your safe remains locked,
please leave the floor.

101
00:09:59,583 --> 00:10:02,583
Four contestants left for the semifinals.

102
00:10:03,083 --> 00:10:04,000
Fireball,

103
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:05,458
Valiant,

104
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:06,541
Neo,

105
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:10,916
and Mr. Nervous Guy.

106
00:10:14,083 --> 00:10:16,416
Quiet please.

107
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:20,083
The clock is set.

108
00:10:20,583 --> 00:10:21,791
Ready,

109
00:10:23,041 --> 00:10:26,208
and crack!

110
00:10:54,041 --> 00:10:56,041
Neo's on to the second dial.

111
00:10:59,208 --> 00:11:01,250
And so is Mr. Nervous Guy.

112
00:11:16,416 --> 00:11:18,666
Whoo!

113
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:28,541
A second place finish
from Mr. Nervous Guy.

114
00:11:29,541 --> 00:11:32,333
Could we be looking at a new champion?

115
00:11:36,416 --> 00:11:39,083
Your bets please.
Place your bets.

116
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:43,333
The clock is set for three minutes.

117
00:11:43,875 --> 00:11:48,291
If neither competitor finishes,
we default to a tie.

118
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:52,208
Ready,

119
00:11:53,708 --> 00:11:54,875
set,

120
00:11:56,166 --> 00:11:58,666
and crack!

121
00:12:29,958 --> 00:12:31,083
Already?

122
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,583
That's a difficult one.

123
00:12:41,875 --> 00:12:44,416
Wow. Oh, no, only one minute left,

124
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,083
but I haven't even started
to crack my safe yet.

125
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,958
Yeah, probably because you don't know how.

126
00:12:51,125 --> 00:12:53,708
Hey.
So this is bad news for me, isn't it?

127
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,125
-I just want to clarify once more--
-Zip it!

128
00:12:57,208 --> 00:12:59,833
Okay. If you say so.

129
00:13:38,875 --> 00:13:42,791
Ladies and gentlemen,
there's a new kid in town!

130
00:13:49,833 --> 00:13:51,625
I love you, Nervous Guy!

131
00:13:54,291 --> 00:13:56,416
It's just training and a lot of practice.

132
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:58,333
I'm gonna kill you!

133
00:13:58,416 --> 00:14:02,791
I'm gonna kill you! I'll kill you!
I'll kill you, you little shit!

134
00:14:05,125 --> 00:14:06,125
Thank you.

135
00:14:07,583 --> 00:14:08,708
Thank you.

136
00:14:15,125 --> 00:14:17,500
<i>That was when I first saw her.</i>

137
00:14:17,583 --> 00:14:19,541
<i>The woman I would come to know</i>
<i>as Gwendoline.</i>
